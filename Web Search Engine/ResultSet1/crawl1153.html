civilians.<span>&nbsp; </span>Russia and China are against
our opening fire on Syria, and they&rsquo;re using the United Nations to register
their dissention, asking why we&rsquo;re not waiting for UN weapons inspectors to
make a report before the bombing is to begin. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The UN is expected to authorize the use of
force by the US against Syria.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So have
we seen real proof of the chemical attack or the trail of evidence? Ron Paul&rsquo;s
son Rand Paul asks the question today &ndash;Is it possible that the anti-government
forces in Syria are the ones who actually used those chemical weapons on civilians
so that the US would attack the Assad government?<span>&nbsp; </span>Either way, Texas Senator John Cornyn and two
or three dozen other Congresspeople are demanding that President Obama bring
his case to Congress, as the Constitution demands, before any attack. </span></p>

situation in Syria has deteriorated &ndash; some say there are few options for the Western
allies left.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As US Army major David
French puts it so eloquently, the failure by the Obama administration to make a
decision has put us in a bad situation -- there was not long ago a rebellion by
relatively moderate people in Syria, the kind of people who would welcome help
from the US.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the US sat on the
sidelines because it wanted to engage with Syrian leader Bashir Al Assad the
same way it had with the regime in Iran.<span>&nbsp;</span>Talking about possible peace talks.<span>&nbsp;</span>But as the rebels in Syrian started to fight, they started to lose
battle after battle, so jihadists began to move in from all over the middle
east.<span>&nbsp; </span>They joined the rebels to try to
take down the Assad regime.<span>&nbsp; </span>But while
the Obama administration sat on the sideline, jihadists and al Qaeda fighters
took over the rebel cause.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>

100-thousand dead civilians later, we can&rsquo;t buddy up to Assad and the jihadist
rebels don&rsquo;t really want to alighn with us, though they will take whatever aid
we offer them.<span>&nbsp; </span>But are those rebels
working with us or are their interests similar to ours?<span>&nbsp; </span>No.<span>&nbsp; </span>WE
have in common with the rebels in Syria little more than contempt for Bashir Al
assad.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re working alongside al Qaeda
here.<span>&nbsp; </span>And after the use of chemical
weapons, we&rsquo;re left few options other than bombing campaigns.<span>&nbsp; </span>Word is US air strikes will target half a
dozen air fields in Syria plus military installations &ndash; warplanes will fly from
Cypress and cruise missiles may be lobbed from one of the four destroyers the

it will last three days.<span>&nbsp; </span>If we&rsquo;re being

Muslim Brotherhood.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is the release of
all this information in the best interests of our efforts in the middle
east?<span>&nbsp; </span>Russian Deputy Premier Dimitri

Anyone else should just &ldquo;get in touch with&rdquo; their colleagues, perhaps even &ldquo;write a letter&rdquo; asking for their views. What was once a mild rash has become a contagious bug and we need to find a vaccine for all this reaching out.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><span>&quot;The people who 'reach out' are also those whose thinking is always &ldquo;blue sky,&quot; who can&rsquo;t describe anything vaguely contemporary without incorrectly enlisting phrases such as &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; or &ldquo;modernist&rdquo; and who don&rsquo;t have to hurry to the airport but need to &ldquo;rocket&rdquo; there. But for now if we can just get everyone to delete &ldquo;reach out&rdquo; from their memory banks, opening our emails will be a less tense experience. And if they don&rsquo;t, perhaps we&rsquo;ll have to reach out &ndash; and grab them by the throat.&quot;<br />
