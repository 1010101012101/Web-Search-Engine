    <h3 class="Company">About Us</h3>
    <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>TriggerNews<sup>&reg;</sup> is a premium, low-cost subscription news service developed
    and offered by News Technologies LLC.</P>
    <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
    TriggerNews is an idea born from the desire to get meaningful and sometimes
    difficult-to-get information about companies or influential worldwide events as quickly as
    professional brokerage firms and traders, in order to level the playing field when buying or
    selling stocks.  Generally-speaking, it is news that moves stocks up or down and key news events
    such as earnings announcements, major contract awards, government regulatory approvals, stock
    splits, law suits, credit changes, etc., will usually spike stock prices within moments after
    publication.  Even a worldwide breaking news event can have major impact.  Consider examples
    like a devastating earthquake hitting Silicon Valley or war breaking out in Korea.  Getting news
    like that within seconds of a newswire transmission can lead to dramatic results.

    <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
    In early 2001, the founders realized that many on-line tools and services were
    available for the average investor.  These included real-time charts (Level 1 and Level 2) and
    real-time quotes.  <U>No</U> service existed to easily obtain selective real-time news.
    </P>
    <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>To the average investor, the usual news acquisition mechanism is email, which
    more often than not is delivered many minutes or even hours after a news release.
    In today's fast-moving trading environment, this means by the time an email is received, significant
    up or down stock reactions most likely occurred and a profit opportunity lost.</P>

    <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>News Technologies was therefore founded on the principle of providing decision-making
    information to the general public about publicly traded companies or worldwide breaking news in the
    fastest manner possible.
    <I>Our goal is to deliver real-time news or news releases within 5 seconds of it hitting the wire</I>,
    thereby making it generally available to our subscribers at the same time it is available to professional
    trading firms.
    The process is greatly enhanced through the application of user-defined &quot;triggers&quot; to route
    selective news to the subscriber based on company name, trading symbol and/or any key word phrase.
