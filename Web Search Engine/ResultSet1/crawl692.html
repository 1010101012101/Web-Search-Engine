		<div class="entry-content">
                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Among operations the Pentagon is eyeing in efforts to cut its overall budget:&#0160; stopping the presses of <em>Stars and Stripes</em>, a newspaper that made its debut in 1861 during the Civil War and since World War I has been eagerly read mainly by military personnel around the world, reports <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The daily newspaper, receiving a slim $7.8 million Defense Department subsidy for 2014, doesn’t make much of a dent in the Pentagon’s overall budget with defense spending this year passing the $700 billion mark.&#0160; But the Pentagon next year faces a $52 billion cut from planned spending levels and every one of its operations is being scrutinized.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>(Yet, budget-cutting Pentagon still has a fat checkbook. &#0160;An <em>Associated</em> <em>Press</em> story over the weekend reports the &#0160;Pentagon is buying more than five dozen Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters to outfit Afghanistan’s security forces.&#0160; Price tag:&#0160; more than $1 billion.) </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Stars and Stripes generates a good chunk of its budget internally via advertising, sales and special issues on education, insurance, retirement planning and travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Over the years, Stars and Stripes provides an editorially independent voice to its readers, now numbering about 200,000.&#0160; That’s down from its peak of more than one million during World War II but today the newspaper is seeing a growing online presence.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The publication maintains news bureaus in Europe, the Pacific and the Middle East to provide first-hand reporting on events in those theaters. In addition to news and sports, its contents contain all the elements of an American hometown paper.&#0160; That includes comics, puzzles and entertainment stories.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Stars and Stripes&#0160;got its start when 10 Union soldiers utilized the abandoned newspaper office of the Bloomfield (Mo.) Herald.&#0160; (Returning to its roots, The Stars and Stripes Museum/Library is located in that city.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">At one point, the newspaper had 25 publishing locations in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The number of editions touched 35 during World War II, with up to 24 adless pages per issue.&#0160; Pacific editions, also without ads, started in 1945.&#0160; Stars and Stripes has since been a prime source of daily information for U.S. forces from the Korean War, Vietnam War, Persian Gulf War to Iraq and Afghanistan.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">While in past years most staffers wore U.S. military uniforms representing Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force, today its publisher and most of its employees are civilians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Associated Press</em> <strong>transmitted one of its rare “flashes” to announce Nelson Mandela’s death…</strong>TV news channels were excited when a vehicle transporting radioactive isotope cobalt-60 was hijacked near Mexico City.&#0160; <strong>“It may be headed toward the U.S. border,” they promptly exclaimed, hinting about a possible sinister purpose.&#0160;</strong> But the vehicle and its lethal contents were found two days later near the stolen site…The <em>New York Times</em> ran a <strong>long piece on restaurants, mentioning No. 66 opening in an upscale eatery area</strong> --- <em>in far-off New Orleans</em>…Look for a weekly print version (which ceased last year) of <em>Newsweek</em> to reappear next month or in February…It <strong>didn’t get the super national coverage that recent happenings of Toronto’s mayor Rob Ford received</strong>, but <em>Statesboro (Ga.) Herald</em> business editor Jan Moore was elected mayor of Statesboro, Bulloch County’s largest city, with a population of about 30,000…<strong>Big radio buzz in Southern California talk radio </strong>has Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and Clark Howard moving to KTLK, Los Angeles, next month.&#0160; Meanwhile, booming <strong>KFI, Los Angeles,</strong> <strong>goes all local with live chatter</strong>…TV and radio news continues to drop everything to air <strong>released audio recordings, such as 911 calls, of major</strong> <strong>past events</strong>.&#0160; Last week the focus was on <em>year-old</em> 911 calls from the <strong>Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings&#0160;</strong>in Newtown, Conn. &#0160;After the airing, legal analyst Mark Geragos said the decision to air the recordings was wrong.&#0160; <em>“Other than pure titillation, I don’t see any public interest served by this whatsoever</em>,” he said.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">A (huh?) report from the Federal Reserve last week noted the U.S. economy in recent months expanded at a <em>“modest to moderate”</em> pace. &#0160;</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">Now, that’s a precise, nifty indicator.</span></p>

                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">At a time when most newspaper readers seek more front-page news, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> on Wednesday turned over a chunk of its opening page to The Walt Disney Co. for a sprawling movie ad that included space where normally a top headline is placed, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In the process, only three news stories appeared on the front page. &#0160;Usually four to six reports run on its opening page.&#0160; (This compared with 15 to 18 opening-page stories when <em>The Times</em>, with greater competition from five other dailies in the city, produced “newsy” front --- and larger --- pages with eight columns.)</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The Disney ad, in white letters against a blue background, stretched across the top of the page, down the left side at almost a column width and full-width across the bottom in continuing the message.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“In the past, <em>The Times</em> has sold movie tie-in wraps around the front page, done fake front pages that cause controversy&#0160;or sold a chunk of the page for advertising,” Kevin Roderick wrote on his <em>LA</em> <em>Observed</em> website. “This is the first time I remember <em>The Times </em>(or any other top U.S. newspaper) dropping half of the content on its actual front page for an ad --- in this case for an advertiser the paper regularly covers and a movie it will also cover.”</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Roderick, who labeled it a “garishly unattractive Disney movie ad,” added that in <em>The Times</em> newsroom “there is a growing sense that the editors and publisher no longer care much about the printed paper, feeling that the future is digital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>USA TODAY AND MCCLATCHY JOIN IN NIXING WHITE HOUSE PHOTO HANDOUTS</strong>.&#0160; Joining three dozen other news outlets that are nixing White House-provided photography, including images of President Barack Obama, are <em>USA Today</em>, the leading <em>Gannett Co.</em> newspaper, and <em>McClatchy Co.</em> which operates 30 daily newspapers.&#0160; <em>USA Today</em> said it will not use handouts originating from the White House Press Office, except in “very extraordinary circumstances.”&#0160; <em>McClatchy</em> editors simply said they will not publish photography issued by the White House.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Quiz time: &#0160;</strong>What was the most overused word (especially in advertisements and broadcast coverage) since last Wednesday? &#0160;<em>See answer below</em>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>IN THE “BAD PR” DEPARTMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR A CITY:</strong>&#0160; Huntington Beach, Calif., was threatening Johnny’s Saloon, a fixture in the Orange County beach city for three decades, with a $960 fine unless it removes a large rooftop POW-MIA sign that reads: <strong><em>THANK</em> <em>A VETERAN FOR YOUR FREEDOM!</em>&#0160;&#0160; </strong>Popular with veterans, the sign has been up for six years.&#0160; Said a city spokesperson:<em>“We have been unable to locate a building and electrical permit for the roof sign so we need the owner to demonstrate that it has been permitted.”</em></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>&#0160;</em></span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>NEW MEANING FOR THE MILE-HIGH CITY.</strong>&#0160; The <em>Denver Post</em> appointed Ricardo Baca as the editor overseeing coverage of the recreational marijuana law that takes effect next month.&#0160; Baca, with the <em>Post</em> for nearly 12 years, was entertainment editor and music critic at the paper.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>ON TOP OF THE NEWS.</strong> &#0160;Some <em>Bloomberg Businessweek </em>subscribers still have not received the much-heralded 212-page Nov. 18 issue, its largest since 1999.&#0160; Missing that issue, callers to its subscription service were told to hold&#0160;off until Nov. 25, then, if the issue was still missing, to request a copy.&#0160; Those who did call again were informed to expect the slow-to-receive issue in two to four more weeks --- in time for Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Quiz time answer: &#0160;</strong>Doorbusters.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">One of the funniest lines of the week from Jan Leno’s monologue on <em>NBC’</em>s The Tonight Show:&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"> <strong>Obama told Iran “if you like your uranium, you can keep your uranium.”</strong></span></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">White House correspondents and news organizations are grumbling over the barring of photojournalists from many presidential events, observes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Among those calling for better access to President Barack Obama and the White House:&#0160; The White House Correspondents Association, the <em>Associated Press, Reuters, The Washington Post</em> plus broadcast and cable networks. &#0160;They&#39;d rather not rely on events’ handouts provided by the White House.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&quot;Journalists are routinely being denied the right to photograph or videotape the President while he is performing his official duties,” the journalists mention in a letter to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“As surely as if they were placing a hand over a journalist’s camera lens, officials in this administration are blocking the public from having an independent view of important functions of the executive branch of government.”</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The journalists also point out, “The apparent reason for closing certain events to photographers is that these events have been deemed &#39;private.&#39; &#0160;That rationale, however, is undermined when the White House contemporaneously releases its own photograph of a so-called private event through social media.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">They add restrictions on access to such events interfere with legitimate newsgathering, raise constitutional freedom-of-the-press questions and set a dangerous precedent.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“Freezing out reporters from events is not healthy,” sums up Ron Fournier --- <em>National Journal</em> editorial director and national correspondent who earlier worked at <em>AP</em> for 20 years --- in a <em>CNN</em> interview on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>TRIBUNE CO. PLANS ANOTHER ROUND OF STAFF CUTS.</strong>&#0160; Chicago-based <em>Tribune Co</em>., second largest U.S. newspaper publisher, <strong>plans to cut nearly 700 jobs or about 6 percent of its total workforce</strong> over the next year, mainly at its newspaper division that includes the <em>Los Angeles Times, Chicago</em> <em>Tribune</em> and six other newspapers.&#0160; The company, which exited bankruptcy in January, cut 360 jobs companywide in the first nine months of the fiscal year.&#0160; That followed eliminating 800 publishing positions last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK FOCUSES ON GLOBAL WARMING</strong>.&#0160; Rather than devoting more editorial space to top business developments as year-end nears, the weekly spreads its Nov. 25 cover story over <strong>a vast 17 full adless pages of text and photos</strong> (out of 80 pages in the issue) relating to what it sees as future higher sea levels affecting Kiribati, north of Fiji. &#0160;The central Pacific nation spans 33 small islands with a population of 103,000. &#0160;Cover headline for the story:&#0160; <strong><em>This entire country is about to be wiped out by climate change</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>PRESIDENT TARDY FOR LIVE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERVIEW ON THE WEB.&#0160; </strong>President Obama <strong>kept Web viewers</strong> <strong>around the country waiting 30 minutes</strong> beyond the 3 p.m. (Eastern) scheduled time Tuesday for the start of a live stream interview, via the <em>WSJ</em>’s website, led by Gerald Seib, the newspaper’s Washington Bureau chief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>FEDS BYPASS LAS VEGAS THIS TIME,&#0160;GATHER IN CARIBBEAN</strong>.&#0160; Phillip Swarts reports in <em>The Washington Times</em> that “a group of <strong>federal officials skipped chilly Washington this month for a taxpayer-funded trip to the Virgin Islands</strong> in the name of protecting the world’s coral reef.”&#0160; The organizer, Swarts adds, is the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force which “isn’t saying much about the total cost or reasons for the trip or why officials chose the St. Croix beachfront resort Buccaneer Hotel (made famous by an episode of TV’s &#39;The Bachelor&#39;) as their destination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Media bits:</strong> &#0160;Look for <strong>Maria Bartiromo</strong>, who departed CNBC (after 20 years at the cable network) on Friday, <strong>to host a live Sunday show early next year</strong> on <em>Fox News Channel</em> in addition to activities on the <em>Fox Business Network</em>…<em>CNN&#39;</em>s <strong>Jake</strong> <strong>Tapper </strong>will fill in for three weeks on the network&#39;s primetime lineup next month as <strong>Erin Burnett</strong> takes maternity leave.&#0160; Along with that added duty, Tapper will continue to&#0160;host his 4 p.m. (Eastern) “The Lead”…Recently launched <em>Al Jazeera America</em>&#0160;cable news channel’s ratings <strong>averaged around 13,000 viewers </strong>in its first few months, reports the <em>New York Post</em>…The <em>Minneapolis Star</em> <em>Tribune</em> in February will take over printing of the <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">The saga of confusing magazine subscriptions continues.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><em>Fast Company</em>, via an insert in its December issue, pitches readers a “3-for-1 holiday gift giveaway” for “only $12.99” as the one-year rate.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">At the same time, subscribers, in a magazine wraparound, are offered a “2-for-1 holiday offer” for $10.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">Meanwhile, a mailed pitch to subscribers also dangles a 2-for-1 holiday offer, citing “regular cost of 2 subscriptions: $99.80” and “you pay only $10 for “10 more issues (one year)&quot; plus a gift card to send “to announce your valuable gift.”</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Extensive U.S. broadcast and print coverage focusing on embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who admitted smoking crack cocaine, public drinking and foul language, goes into the third week today, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">Media became excited when his rambling rage was captured in a video.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>CNN</em> and <em>Fox News </em>dropped everything earlier this month to cover&#0160;“live” one of his press conferences from the Canadian city.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Yet, his woes started six months ago when a video caught him smoking crack.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Ford’s actions until this month were overlooked by U.S. media which suddenly went overboard detailing the escapades of a foreign country’s mayor like he was head of a major American city.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&quot;In terms of America&#39;s coverage of Canada, (the) story has gotten more coverage than anything I think since the War of 1812,&quot; summed up Howard Kurtz, host of Media Buzz on <em>Fox News</em> yesterday.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">As <em>Wall Street Journal</em> writer Ben Dummett pointed out Saturday, “The mayor of Toronto is in many ways a figurehead, with much less power than in comparable U.S. cities.”</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Ford’s mayoral grip was clipped somewhat on Friday when Toronto’s City Council voted to strip some of his powers.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Despite the negative coverage and cries for him to resign, Ford, according to the <em>Associated Press</em>, said he intends to seek re-election next year.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>PROBLEMS PERSIST WITH THE OBAMACARE WEBSITE. &#0160;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;Opening page of <a href="http://HealthCare.gov/">HealthCare.gov</a> shows the advisory<em>:&#0160; &quot;The Health Insurance Marketplace online application isn&#39;t available from approximately 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. EST daily while we make improvements. &#0160;Additional downtime may be possible as we work to make things better.&quot;</em></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Not widely mentioned by media is that the price tag in developing the website cost more than $400 million.</strong>&#0160; And costs in fixing it will add to that figure.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>POLL: SOME VIEW PRESIDENT OBAMA AS CONSERVATIVE.&#0160; </strong>Three percent of likely U.S. voters consider President Barack Obama conservative, is a finding from a new <em>Rasmussen Reports</em> national telephone survey.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The tally also notes 68 percent consider the president at least somewhat liberal, including 43 percent who believe he is very liberal, while 24 percent rate the president politically moderate.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> issue, <strong>now on newsstands, is the largest</strong> <strong>--- at 212 pages --- since 1999</strong>…<em>CNN</em> named Brian Stelter host of Sunday’s “<strong>Reliable Sources</strong>” and the cable network’s senior media correspondent.&#0160; He was the <em>New York Times</em> media industry reporter...<em>Griffin Communications, </em>owned by David and Kirsten Griffin of Oklahoma City and John Griffin of Muskogee, citing “business is very good,” <strong>gave each employee of its media outlets</strong> <strong>$500</strong>.&#0160; The privately-held media firm includes TV stations <em>KWTV</em>, Oklahoma City, and <em>KOTV</em> and <em>KQCW</em>, Tulsa…<em>Forbes Media</em>, which includes <em>Forbes </em>magazine and Web properties, is considering selling the operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><em>Writer’s Digest </em></strong><strong>is pitching a one-year subscription for “only” $11.96.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>But wait.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong> Potential subscribers have to add $3 for shipping and handling. </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>So why not make the offer simply $14.96 without the fine print?</strong></span></em></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Media continue to intensify global warming reports while overlooking
unseasonal cold, finds <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.&#0160; Latest example was the excitement at <em>CBS News.</em></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Matthew Balan at <em>NewsBusters</em> points out, “Scott Pelley hyped the latest global warming
report on Wednesday&#39;s&#0160;<em>CBS Evening News</em>, proclaiming that &quot;<strong>climate
scientists have never seen greenhouse gas readings like what they announced
today</strong>...scientists with the United Nations said that greenhouse gases,
which influence climate change, have&#0160;<strong>hit their highest level in 800,000
years,”</strong> pinning the blame on industry ramping up in the developing world.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Were any eyebrows
raised at <em>CBS</em> on the 800,000 years
reference?&#0160; At around 797,987 B.C.,
<strong>Grumpy Editor</strong> wonders what kind of
weather instruments and tree rings were used to calculate &quot;warming.&quot;</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Nothing is mentioned about meteorological specialists in
United Nations’ purposes and principles that include maintaining international
peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and “to achieve
international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic,
social, cultural, or humanitarian character.”</span></strong>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile, most
media are quiet about unusual cold smacking parts of the U.S. &#0160;The <em>Climate
Depot</em> website reveals Spokane International Airport received 1.9 inches
of snow Tuesday,&#0160;snapping a 66-year-old daily record.&#0160; It edged the 1.8 inches recorded on
Nov. 5, 1947.&#0160; Also on Nov. 5, a
record snowfall of 5.7 inches was measured in Sioux Falls, S.D., breaking the old
record of 1.5 inches set in 1959.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Into the mix,
<em>NewsBusters</em> last Thursday reports:&#0160;
“Far from disappearing, Antarctic ice levels reached a record high on
Sept. 22.” </span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Is the
Teleprompter responsible?</strong>&#0160; With
President Barack Obama last week altering what he said (at least 36 times) about OmabaCare with:&#0160; “What we
said was you could keep (that plan) if it hasn’t changed since the law was
passed.”&#0160; This differs from earlier statements that repeated, “If you like&#0160;your health
plan, you can keep it.”&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Strange
selection.</strong>&#0160; <em>The Wall Street Journal’s </em>sole front-page photo last Monday was an
above-the-fold, one-liner caption-only showing four women in Jordan watching a
“hybrid” eclipse.&#0160; Captions on
other photos that day brought confusion.&#0160;
An <em>Associated Press</em>-supplied
photo linked to a story on India’s plan to launch a spacecraft was incorrectly
attributed to <em>Agence France-Presse/Getty
Images </em>in some editions.&#0160; Also,
in connection with an article on voting in Kosovo, some editions credited a <em>Reuters</em> photo to <em>Zuma Press</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Had enough of
the Toronto mayor coverage?</strong>&#0160; A
whole week of focusing on a mayor based in another country filled U.S. broadcast and
print news.&#0160; That
included&#0160;coverage of a press conference, live on <em>Fox News</em> and <em>CNN</em>, in which Rob Ford, Toronto mayor,
admitted smoking crack cocaine plus additional extensive airtime and print
space --- all the way through the weekend --- devoted to Ford’s rambling rage
captured in a video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Another mayor
story few know about.&#0160; </strong>Ed Engler, editor and
president of the <em>Laconia</em> <em>Daily Sun</em> is the new mayor of the New
Hampshire city.&#0160; He will&#0160;be
sworn in tomorrow and begins his term in January. So who will cover City Hall for the <em>Sun</em>?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Good comparison.</strong>&#0160; A print ad by State Street Global Advisors for SPDR, an
exchange traded fund, grabbed readers’ eyes with:&#0160; TRADED MORE OFTEN THAN A VETERAN BASEBALL PLAYER.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>More print jobs lost.</strong>&#0160; The move to print the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at the Dallas
Morning News next year means 275 people, including 75 full timers, will be
dropped from the payroll.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Zombies
in Washington?&#0160; The latest <em>Rasmussen Reports</em> finds 37 percent of
adults surveyed feel zombies would do a better job running the U.S. today.&#0160; On the other hand, the survey notes
just as many (37 percent) believe the federal government would do a better job
than zombies in running the country while 26 percent can’t decide between the
two.</span></strong></span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">While
Washington media were focusing on President Barack Obama meeting in the White
House for two hours Friday with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to discuss
ways to work together in efforts to stop the al-Qaida threat, the president
issued an executive order --- missed by many editors --- directing a government-wide effort to
boost regional preparation for global warming’s&#0160;impact, noted <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The action
came just before an unusual meteorological weekend in the U.S. that brought a
mix of snow and rain across the Great Lakes to northern New England along with a series of winter
storms moving through the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies accompanied by
strong winds and heavy snow at higher elevations.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>With this, and
snubbed by (usually weather-conscious) media, was that daily high temperatures
late last week in places&#0160;like Chicago and Detroit were running up to a
cool 15 degrees <em>below</em> average.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Obama’s action, as reported by Dave Boyer in <em>The Washington Times</em>, orders federal agencies to work with states to build “resilience” against
major storms and other weather extremes.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Boyer said
the order declared:&#0160; “The impacts
of climate change --- including an increase in prolonged periods of excessively
high temperatures, more heavy downpours, an increase in wildfires, more severe
droughts, permafrost thawing, ocean acidification and sea-level rise --- are
already affecting communities, natural resources, ecosystems, economies and
public health across the nation. The federal government must build on recent
progress and pursue new strategies to improve the nation’s preparedness and
resilience.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Meanwhile, some newspapers yesterday
carried an <em>Associated Press</em> story
previewing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report next March
that will indicate “how global warming already is affecting the way people live
and what will happen in the future, including a worldwide drop in income.”</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">While the
spotlight was on “warming,” the word <em>cold</em>
was absent in the story.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Social Security benefits for nearly 58 million people will rise in
2014 by 1.5 percent, one of the smallest increases since automatic adjustments were adopted in
1975.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Official reason
for the skimpy raise: Consumer prices
haven’t gone up much in the past year. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">As media have been reporting for months ---
inflation is “tame.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">That leaves many budget-squeezed
seniors, facing higher costs on multiple fronts, shaking their heads.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>USA Today </em>claimed top spot in U.S. newspaper
circulation, sending <em>The Wall Street
Journal</em> to No. 2.&#0160; The <em>Gannett Co.</em>&#0160;publication accomplished the position
with 2.9 million daily average circulation for the six months ended Sept. 30 by
<strong>including print and various digital editions.&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong><br /></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The San<em>
Francisco Chronicle</em> was the latest publication to ban use of <strong>“Redskins”</strong>
in&#0160; referring to Washington, D.C.’s
professional football team --- which has been <strong>using the name since 1933</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Readers’choice:</strong>&#0160; November issue of <em>Sunset</em>
magazine, in the <em>Time Inc.</em> family,
included two different subscription cards.&#0160; A two-for-one deal put the one-year term at $24.&#0160; Another card promised 12 months for
$29.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Will Washington watch?&#0160;</strong> Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-Texas) guests on <em>NBC</em>’s “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno”
on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>U-T,</em> the
San Diego daily, in a deal expected to close today, purchased from Mainstreet
Communications <strong>eight San Diego County community newspapers</strong> including the <em>Del Mar Times, La Jolla Light, Rancho Santa
Fe Review </em>and<em> Poway News Chieftain.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em><br /></em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Broadcast media became excited last week when what was initially termed a
large explosion followed by gunfire was heard near the U.S. embassy </strong><strong>in Sana’a, Yemen&#39;s capital, with a population of 1.7 million.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>It turned
out to be fireworks from a wedding…which media decided not to cover.</strong></span></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Nearing year-end, executives at major newspapers are sprouting more gray
hairs as traditional advertising revenue continues to decline and print
readership becomes shakier with a fuzzy national outlook, observes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Subscribers, facing higher costs --- ranging from health
insurance to groceries --- look for
items to trim.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>High on the
list:&#0160; print subscriptions.&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Periodic cuts in newsroom staffers, resulting in fewer features and
coverage, such as no Monday business sections, also set readers
grumbling.&#0160; Science and investigative reporters, as examples, are becoming
rare birds in newsrooms.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Grumpy readers also are miffed at the slant, or spin,
some&#0160;newspapers place on coverage and opinions that may disagree with
their own (neutrality used to be emphasized in
journalism).&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Latest
development to irk print readers is a barrier thrown up on the
letters-to-the-editor page.&#0160; The <em>Los
Angeles Times </em>says it will no longer print letters from “climate change
deniers.”&#0160; Meanwhile, other dailies are cutting back on space devoted to
readers’ letters.</strong><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">So how are major <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/industry/Newspapers" rel="wikinvest" target="_blank" title="Newspapers">newspaper publishing</a> companies doing?&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The <strong><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.mcclatchy.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="The McClatchy Company">McClatchy Co.</a>, </strong>the U.S.’s third largest newspaper operation
that includes 30 dailies, last week reported third quarter total revenues
of&#0160; $293.6 million, down 4.2 percent from the like year-earlier period,
while advertising revenues were $194.9 million, off 8.1 percent.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">However, third quarter circulation revenues were up 6.5 percent from
the same period in 2012, bolstered by the company’s digital subscription
package, known as the Plus Program.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">McClatchy total revenues in the first nine months were down 3.8
percent to $897.5 million, compared to $933.1 million last year.&#0160; Results
included a $12.9 million ($8.2 million after-tax) gain related to&#0160;<em>Miami Herald</em> property sold.&#0160;
Advertising revenues in the period totaled $599.6 million, down 6.9 percent
while circulation revenues were up 4.2 percent to $261.3 million.&#0160;</span></p>

plus operator of broadcast outlets, last week reported third quarter revenue
from its publishing business declined 3.6 percent from the like year-earlier
period&#0160;while print advertising revenue slipped 5.9 percent and circulation
revenue ebbed 0.6 percent. &#0160;Overall Gannett profit in the period fell to
$79.7 million from $131.1 million.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile, <strong><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.tribune.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Tribune Company">Tribune Co.</a>, </strong>which emerged from bankruptcy at the
end of 2012, comes out with third quarter results in late November.&#0160;
Earlier, the parent of the <em>Chicago
Tribune, Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Baltimore
Sun</em> and others, reported second quarter net income tumbled 61.2 percent to
$66.3 million from the same year-earlier period as revenue in its publishing
unit declined 4 percent to $470 million.&#0160; The newspaper unit’s ad revenue
dropped 7 percent to $262 million.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Print advertising at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/new_york_times_company" target="_self" title="New York Times Co.">New York Times Co.</a></strong></span>&#0160;in the second
quarter saw national advertising slip 3.5 percent, retail advertising slump
12.9 percent and classified ads drop 8.6 percent from a year prior.&#0160; The
company&#39;s third quarter results, due to be released tomorrow, are expected to show a rise in that period&#39;s circulation revenue stemming from
digital subscriptions and a print circulation price boost.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">At the <strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com" target="_self" title="Washington Post Co.">Washington Post Co.</a></strong>, newspaper division print
advertising revenue, including that of flagship <em>Washington Post</em>, fell 4 percent to $54.5&#0160;million in the second
quarter, compared with the like year-earlier quarter. &#0160;Average print
circulation for this year’s first half slipped 7.1 percent to 447,700 on
weekdays and 7.6 percent to 646,700 on Sundays compared with the same year-ago
period. &#0160;Third quarter results are slated for Friday release.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">With a downward drift in newspapers’ print advertising, Rick Edmonds,
researcher and writer for Poynter Institute on business and journalism issues,
declared indications are that “the (newspaper) industry will again lose more
than $1 billion in advertising year-to-year in 2013.” &#0160;&#0160;</span></strong></span></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">No, it wasn’t a TV movie.&#0160; Looking for guns, 30 armed police in
tactical gear raided a financial adviser’s home in the Georgetown section of
Washington, handcuffed him and his girlfriend after pointing guns to their
heads, scared four children during a search of the residence for more than two
hours, while other officers closed neighborhood streets during the process that
turned up no weapons --- with all the action receiving scant media attention,
noted&#0160;<strong>Grumpy Editor.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In the forefront with coverage, however, is <em>Washington Times</em>&#0160;staffer Emily Miller providing details in an Oct. 23 story.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>It’ll be interesting to see media coverage of homeowner Mark
Witaschek’s trial that starts next Monday. &#0160;With no criminal record, he
faces two years in prison for possession of unregistered ammunition, reports Miller, senior editor of opinion at <em>The Times</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">As Miller explains it: While no weapons were found in the house,
police reported finding “one live round of 12-gauge shotgun ammunition,” which
was an inoperable shell that misfired during a hunt years earlier, kept as a
souvenir by Witaschek, and “one expended round of .270 caliber ammunition”
along with “one box of Knight bullets for reloading” which Miller --- author of
the 2013 book, “Emily Gets Her Gun” --- notes “are actually not for reloading,
but are used in antique-replica, single-shot, muzzle-loading rifles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Miller, in her story, quotes Witaschek saying that soon after entering
the premises, “police used a battering ram to bash down the bathroom door”
where his 16-year-old son was pulled out of the shower, naked. &#0160;“The
police put all the children together in a room, while we were handcuffed
upstairs. I could hear them crying, not knowing what was happening.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Witaschek says the search caused an estimated $10,000 in damage,
documented by photos he took after the July, 2012 incident.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Read Miller’s full story <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/23/miller-dc-businessman-faces-two-years-jail-unregis" target="_self">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>In case you missed these...</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>+ &#0160;President
Barack Obama&#39;s proposal to create a “unisex” look via a new boxy cap for both
male and female Marines</strong> has triggered a storm in the
ranks, with some charging that the headgear gives the tough Leathernecks a
&quot;girly&quot; look. &#0160;<strong>Looking
like a</strong> <strong>cross between a French
Foreign Legion cap and something worn by 1950s-era airline stewardesses </strong>(as
they were called then), the price tag for the cap conversion will cost $8.2
million, according to an internal memo obtained by the&#0160;<em>New York Post</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>+ &#0160;Front-page headlines after one of the wildest endings of a World Series baseball
game</strong> Saturday night in St. Louis with the score tied, two out in the
bottom of the ninth inning, when an obstruction charge resulted in the
Cardinals beating the Boston Red Sox 5 to 4:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Boston Herald</em> --- <strong>FOR THE BIRDS!</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Boston Globe</em> --- <strong>Cardinals win in wild finish</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> --- <strong>A LEG UP</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">+ &#0160;Was she fired? &#0160;<em>BuzzFeed Politics</em> notes the <strong>woman pictured on the Healthcare.gov home page is gone --- mysteriously vanished</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">+ &#0160;Look for heavy coverage by television networks on and around
Nov. 22 with special reports and broadcasts marking the <strong>50th anniversary of
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>+ &#0160;Radio news continues with the bad habit of not
pinpointing the precise location in top-of-the-hour breaking news.</strong>&#0160;
Latest:&#0160; <em>ABC </em>with a lead item Tuesday on a school shooting by a student,
mentioning only that it was in Nevada --- omitting it occurred in Sparks, near
Carson City.&#0160; News editors forget that the Silver State, with 110,567 square miles, ranks seventh
largest in size among the 50 states.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>+ &#0160;Condé Nast</em>, publisher of 25 magazines, including <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Glamour,

Digest</em>, is <strong>shelving its internship program</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">+ &#0160;Fifth annual edition of &quot;Hot Careers for College Graduates,”
compiled by University of California San Diego Extension, <strong>places public</strong> <strong>relations
specialists in ninth spot</strong>.&#0160; Topping the list:&#0160; Software

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In a periodic reminder that Los Angeles area
residents live in an earthquake zone, the <em>Los
Angeles Times</em> produced another shaker piece last week, this time focusing
on “more
than 1,000 old concrete buildings in Los Angeles and hundreds more throughout
the county may be at risk of collapsing in a major earthquake,” observed <strong>Grumpy Editor.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The triple-byline story, based on a <em>Times</em> analysis, pointed out many older concrete
structures “are vulnerable to the sideways movement of a major earthquake
because they don&#39;t have enough steel reinforcing bars to hold columns in
place.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Earthquake
forecasts aimed at Californians seem to be an almost annual ritual to shake up
readers and residents who don’t need to be reminded they are in earthquake
territory, just as other parts of the country are
susceptible to hurricanes, overflowing rivers, tornadoes and blizzards.</strong><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Prior “shake ‘em up” stories by the <em>Associated Press </em>warned:</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">+ California faces an almost certain risk
of being rocked by a strong earthquake by 2037, citing a seismic forecast by scientists that pointed to a magnitude 6.7 quake
(equal to the 1994 Northridge jolt) or larger. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">+&#0160; A hypothetical model
indicated a 7.8 magnitude earthquake would “see Los Angeles and its suburbs
shake like a bowl of jelly” in less than two minutes and 50,000 people would be
injured.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">+&#0160; “Seismic
jiggling” via a swarm of small earthquakes near the southern end of the San
Andreas Fault has some people wondering if the “swarm is just a warm-up to a
major quake,” causing serious damage to the greater Los Angeles region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Separately,
the </strong><strong><em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong><strong> said it will no&#0160;longer print letters from “climate change
deniers.” </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The newspaper’s letters editor declared,
“Saying there&#39;s no sign humans have caused climate change is not stating an
opinion, it&#39;s asserting a factual inaccuracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Two contrasting items on Verizon Communications Inc</strong>. in Friday’s <em>Wall Street
Journal</em>.&#0160; In “the good news”
portion of its “Stocks in the News” feature, the <em>WSJ</em> pointed out Verizon’s $1.65 gain in Thursday’s trading was
attributed to <em>“the phone carrier reported
40 percent growth in third quarter net income.” </em>A few pages away, the
headline on a long story read, <em>“Verizon
Reports</em> <em>Slowdown In Growth.”</em>&#0160; Nevertheless, Verizon’s stock added
another $1.11 in Friday’s trading to close at $50.01.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Delayed by the partial
U.S.&#0160;government shutdown, the <strong>September
employment report from the Labor Department will be released tomorrow </strong>while
this month’s <strong>employment data will be pushed back a week to Nov. 8</strong>.&#0160; Meanwhile, in a two-week delay, the <strong>consumer price index, measuring inflation,
was set for Oct. 30 release.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> veered from
focusing on business to slamming the tea party with the cover of its current
issue showing <strong>Ted Cruz, R-Texas, dressed
as the Mad Hatter</strong> with the line:&#0160;
<em>The Tea Party Won.&#0160; </em><em>Ted
Cruz and his band of dead enders took the U.S. through the looking glass. Now
crazy is the new normal…</em><strong>Also indicating
its political stance</strong> with the partial shutdown (neutrality used to be
emphasized in journalism) was<em> </em>Thursday&#39;s <em>NBC Nightly News, </em>with anchor Brian
Williams declaring:&#0160; <em>“Politically,
it&#39;s widely agreed to have been a big loss and self-inflicted wound mostly for
the Republican Party.&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>A key reason why young people do not read newspapers and magazines:</strong> <em>CNSNews.com</em>
reported an international survey from the U.S. Department of Education&#39;s
National Center for Education Statistics found <strong>Americans’ adult skills in literacy were tied in 15<sup>th</sup> place </strong>(with
Germany) among 23 advanced economies. Top three?&#0160; Japan, Finland and The Netherlands.&#0160; See the tally <strong><a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/23-advanced-economies-us-adults-rank-21st-math-skills" target="_self">here</a></strong>…Latest <em>Rasmussen Reports</em> national survey found <strong>78 percent of likely U.S. voters would vote to oust the entire
Congress and start over again.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>&#0160;</strong>Bank your dollars.&#0160; This is National Save for Retirement Week.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Now that the 16-day partial
government shutdown is over, look for the recent days’ overused phrase --- <em>kick the can</em> <em>down the road ---&#0160;</em>not popping up again until deep into the holiday
season...prior to another crisis looming early next year.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong><br /></strong></span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong> notes most print/broadcast media overlooked two
noteworthy events last week:&#0160; an
unusually early and wicked snowstorm packing hurricane force winds that smacked
South Dakota and southwestern North Dakota, killing almost 80,000 cattle, and
the 12<sup>th</sup> year mark reached by the U.S.&#0160;military fighting in
Afghanistan --- making that conflict more than three times longer than the
U.S.&#0160;involvement in World War II.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">With the early October storm, up to four feet of snow
fell in southwestern South Dakota.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Cattle
ranchers, along with farmers, faced a major problem with assistance because of
the partial shutdown of the federal government, leaving them without an agency
to report financial losses.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The South Dakota Stock Growers Assn. estimated 15 to 20
percent of cattle died in some parts of the state.&#0160; Some ranchers said half or more of their herds were lost.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">A calf normally sells for about $1,000, while a
mature cow brings $1,500 and up.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Todd Campbell, executive director of the Grand
River Grazing Cooperative, Lemmon, S.D., said many ranchers had difficulty
getting out to their cattle.&#0160;
Compounding the situation was phone service disruption.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Lucas Lentsch, South Dakota agriculture secretary, termed the
early-season blizzard “devastating to our producers.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">South Dakota Cattlemen’s Assn. said the storm’s
effects would be felt for years.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>U.S. troops entered Afghanistan Oct. 7, 2001</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile with Afghanistan, one of the few
newspapers reporting the dozen years of U.S. boots on the ground there was <em>Stars and</em> <em>Stripes</em>.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Staffer Heath Druzin reported the conflict has
been “seemingly forgotten by most Americans who’ve grown weary of
war.”&#0160; He pointed out the U.S.
launched Operation Enduring Freedom on Oct. 7, 2001 and 54,000 American troops
remain in Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>“That
is more, by far, than at any time during the first seven years of the war, yet
these days, they garner scant news coverage,” he added.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The <em>S&amp;S</em>
writer mentioned Army Staff Sgt. Mike Toole, a member of III Corps based in
Kabul, said he understands the dwindling interest back home:&#0160; “After 12 years, people are going to
get tired of it,” Toole said. “I mean, we’re tired of it, so it makes sense to
me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">But next year will see the U.S.’s “formal mission” in
Afghanistan end as troops pull out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">So far this year 104 Americans have been killed in
Afghanistan, the latest being on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Also
not widely mentioned with the partial shutdown
of the federal government</strong>:&#0160;
Important information from the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.&#0160; That includes auto
recalls and safety complaints. <strong>&#0160;Without the usual warnings, lives and
property are at greater risk</strong>…Also linked to the shutdown, use of <strong>“Gestapo
tactics”</strong> with harsh treatment of senior citizens --- including foreign
visitors --- at Yellowstone National Park, is detailed by the <em>Newburyport</em> (Mass.) <em>Daily News</em>, one of the publications of <em>Eagle-Tribune
Publishing Co.,</em> North Andover, Mass.&#0160; Read the account <a href="http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1442580373/Gestapo-tactics-meet-senior-citizens-at-Yellowstone" target="_self">here</a>.&#0160; (For those fuzzy on the Gestapo description,
it reflects the German secret police during the Nazi regime, organized
in 1933 with its brutal methods and operations through World War II.)</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Media doings:&#0160; A. H. Belo Corp.</strong> sells the <em>Press-Enterprise</em>&#0160;(including its production facility and related land) in Riverside, Calif. to
<strong>Freedom Communications Holdings Inc.</strong> for $27.25 million.&#0160; Santa Ana, Calif.-based Freedom publishes
California newspapers, <em>Daily Press</em>
in Victorville, <em>Desert Dispatch</em> in
Barstow, <em>Long Beach</em> <em>Register</em> in Long Beach and <em>Orange County
Registe</em>r in Santa Ana plus more than 30 community newspapers…Pew Research
Center reports a growing number of <strong>dailies are cutting down editorial and commentary sections </strong>due to
financial concerns…Jessica Yellin is
leaving <em>CNN</em> after six years at the
cable network. The move comes less than two months after she moved to “chief
domestic affairs correspondent” from the White House beat…<strong>With a background of 40 years as a reporter</strong>, Ed
Rabel, former television news correspondent for <em>NBC</em> and <em>CBS</em>, reveals he
is setting up an &quot;exploratory committee&quot; to consider a run for the
House of Representatives from West Virginia…<strong>Neurosurgeon Ben Carson</strong>&#0160;joins<em> Fox News </em>as a&#0160;contributor.&#0160;</span></p>

                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">While the partial U.S. government shutdown has many
people up in arms about some of the strange closures at home and abroad, one of
the most unusual is the “panda cam” that went dark at the National Zoo in
Washington, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Federal resources, including funds, are not an issue in
showing the giant pandas on camera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Thousands of viewers check in daily to see female panda
Mei Xiang, her six-week-old cub and companion Tian Tian. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">National Zoo&#39;s panda cams are sponsored by the Ford
Motor Co. fund, part of a two-year, $400,000 grant to study giant panda health
and the majority of the grant covers research into disease transmission, points
out Danielle Elliot at <em>CBS News</em>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">And zoo staff doesn’t figure into the panda’s cam
transmissions because volunteers operate the cameras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">As part of the Smithsonian Institution, the
National Zoo is a 163-acre zoological park set amid Rock Creek National Park in
the heart of Washington.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">With the shutdown, the zoo and the rest of the Smithsonian
museums are closed to the public along with all vehicle,
pedestrian and bicycle paths into the area.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">For panda cam watchers, an alternative:&#0160; Try the panda cam <a href="http://www.memphiszoo.org/pandacam" target="_self">here</a>&#0160;to see Ya Ya and Le
Le at the Memphis Zoo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">Senator cites shutdown for scrapping
media call</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, cited the federal shutdown as
the reason to eliminate his weekly press call with Iowa
reporters, finds <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“Due to the funding lapse, Senator Harkin’s offices
are now closed. Therefore, he will not host an Iowa media call this week. The
call will resume when the lapse has ended,” Kate Cyrul Frischmann, Harkin’s
communications director in Washington, advised Iowa reporters via email.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">However, the <em>Des
Moines Register</em> reported the federal shutdown didn’t stop U.S. Rep. Bruce
Braley, D-Waterloo, from briefing Iowa reporters on his usual Wednesday
conference call.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Braley, active with other House members while the Senate
was mostly silent, is running for the Senate next year, <em>seeking to replace Harkin, who is retiring.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em><br /></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Two words absent from weekend reporting on the <strong>unusual autumn</strong> <strong>snowstorm</strong> that smacked the upper Midwest with up to almost four feet of
snow (in Lead, S.D.):&#0160; <strong>global warming</strong>…Stock of <strong>Tesla Motors</strong>, following media playing
up a fire in one of its electric cars, dips 6.2 percent on Wednesday and 4.2
percent Thursday, but rebounds 7.67 percent on Friday as word gets out that its
<strong>Model S becomes the best</strong>-<strong>selling car in Norway</strong> in September, its
second month on the market there…<em>The Associated
Press</em> and <em>NPR </em>are <strong>cutting back use of</strong> <strong>the term ObamaCare</strong> (for Affordable Care
Act).&#0160; <em>NPR</em> describes the nickname as seeming &quot;to be straddling
somewhere between being a politically-charged term and an accepted part of the
vernacular”…<strong>Political
columnist and author George Will</strong> joins <em>Fox
News</em> as a contributor.&#0160; Will, a
long-time fixture as a panelist on <em>ABC’</em>s
&quot;This Week with George Stephanopoulos,&quot; will<strong> offer analysis and
commentary</strong> across<em> Fox News’ </em>daytime
and primetime programming…While many newspapers are reducing
editorial content, the 113-year-old <em>Lubbock
</em>(Texas) <em>Avalanche-Journal</em> is
<strong>seeking freelance journalists and photographers to boost news, business, features, community events and sports
coverage</strong>…Wichita radio station<em> KLIO </em><strong>dumps
its oldies format and moves to service its market’s Spanish-speaking population</strong> with sports
talk using&#0160;<em>ESPN Deportes </em>around
the clock…<em>Thomson Reuters</em> plans to
cut as much as 5 percent of newsroom staffers (out of 2,800 journalists
worldwide) --- <strong>“to simplify and strengthen the <em>Reuters</em> news operation”…</strong><em>NBC
</em>and <em>CNN</em> <strong>shelve television
projects focusing on former first lady and secretary of state Hillary
Clinton.</strong>&#0160; Both efforts were slated
to air prior to the 2016 election.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">Media, especially television, gearing up for winds that some predicted would blossom into the first
hurricane to hit the U.S. this year, see tropical storm Karen fizzle in the
Gulf of Mexico…with no deep low-pressure systems (candidates leading to a
hurricane) on the horizon.</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">With most print and broadcast media busy focusing titanic attention on
the looming federal government partial shutdown tonight, noting it would be the
first such action in nearly two decades, <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong> calls attention to a more recent shutdown --- less than seven months
ago with scant coverage --- when Washington turned off the lights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Reason?</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Washington comes to a standstill when only a few inches of snow cripples
the area.&#0160; Thus, it was a “snow day”
--- without coast-to-coast, wide-scale front-page fuss over federal operations
shuttered in the region.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>That’s what
happened March 6 this year in the District of Columbia when the U.S.&#0160;Office of Personnel Management called a snow day,
allowing federal workers to stay home with full pay.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">About 320,000 federal workers are affected when Washington closes office
doors.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Media didn’t get too excited with a questionable shutdown
(via a snow day) in Washington that occurred Christmas week, 2009.&#0160; With a heavy snowfall on Friday night
(Dec. 18) and Saturday, many federal employees stayed home on Monday, without
losing pay --- 36 hours after the flakes stopped falling.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">With the approaching national shutdown, about 40 percent of the
federal workforce of 2 million people could be furloughed without pay.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In the countdown
to a shutdown, Republican action from the House two days ago would keep the
government funded through Dec. 15, delay the health care law, repeal a 2.3
percent medical device tax and assure payments to military personnel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">While House members were busy trying to hammer out a solution over the
weekend, Senate majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., gave members of his
legislative chamber the weekend off.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Senators return today at 2 p.m. --- 10 hours before the fiscal year ends.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Meanwhile, with
the shutdown drama on Capitol Hill, the <em>Washington
Post</em> reported President Obama on Saturday played golf at Fort Belvoir in
Virginia.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>As for today&#39;s weather, no
snow is in the forecast.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>&#0160;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Most newspapers
snub Sen. Cruz’s endurance</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Grumpy Editor</strong> asks: &#0160;If you were a newspaper editor, would you front-page someone speaking 21
hours and 19 minutes non-stop while standing continuously and with no “rest period”
breaks or time out for food?</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Well, most editors around the nation looked the other way when Sen. Ted
Cruz, R-Texas, engaged in a talkathon against the health care law in the Senate
starting last Tuesday afternoon.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Most of the next day’s major newspapers ignored the effort.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Absolutely no
front-page mention, even in briefs, was observed in the <em>New York Times, Detroit News, Washington
Post, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times</em> and <em>Miami Herald</em>.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">However, <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>and
<em>Boston Globe</em> worked in front-page
references to stories inside the “A” sections.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Despite extraordinary use of his voice, before going home Cruz then went
on <em>Rush Limbaugh’s radio talk show</em>
for a further discussion.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed
these…</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>More staff
chopping ahead at Tribune Co.?</strong>&#0160;&#0160;
The parent of the <em>Los Angeles</em> <em>Times, Chicago Tribune</em> and others is in
a budget review process that will determine <strong>further staff reductions</strong>.&#0160; Over the last three years, the company slashed about
2,200 jobs, with about 11,500 remaining on payrolls…London’s <em>Lloyds List</em>, the <strong>world’s oldest continuously published newspaper</strong>,
will end its print edition in December and go digital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In marketing
developments:</strong>&#0160; Burger King promotes new
lower fat/calories fries in the U.S. --- produced by Canadian firm McCain Foods
Ltd., which also makes fries for Wendy’s and McDonalds…<strong>Wrong placement?</strong>&#0160; A TV commercial
for <strong>blackhead dissolving gel</strong> aired over the weekend on the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <em>Editorial
Report</em> on <em>Fox News Channel</em>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>A nifty deal
tailored for&#0160;“Norm” on the old <em>Cheers</em>
TV show: &#0160;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Groupon, the
daily deals website, last week offered eight hours of an open bar at a Las
Vegas Strip location for $24.99 --- “a $50 value.”</strong></span></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Those concerned about ever-increasing electricity bills,
as low-cost coal-fired power plants are shuttered or reduced in numbers, should
be aware that confusion --- overlooked by most media --- exists in Washington
on tough upcoming requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency as it
moves to control carbon pollution, notes <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Associated
Press</em> writer Dina Cappiello, in a weekend story, pointed out,
“the federal government’s own analysis of the new power plant proposal
concludes that it would have a ‘negligible’ impact on carbon dioxide emissions,
pose little to no costs for the industry and provide no additional benefits to
the public by 2022.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>The
EPA, Cappiello mentioned, “does not anticipate this rule will have any impacts
on the price of electricity, employment or labor markets or the U.S. economy.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">However, Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) declared the EPA
was holding the coal industry to “impossible standards,” added Cappiello.&#0160; “If these regulations go into effect,
American jobs will be lost, electricity prices will soar and economic
uncertainty will grow,” warned Manchin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">(Manchin, born in small coal mining town Farmington, W.
Va., was governor of the state from 2005 to 2010.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, reported the <em>AP</em> writer, said the proposed
regulations, “rather than killing future coal, actually sets up a certain
pathway forward for coal to continue to be part of the diverse mix in this
country.”&#0160;</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Most
Democrats flee latest Benghazi hearing</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Ignored by most media was a shameful Capitol Hill happening
involving some members of the House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee who left the second portion of Thursday’s hearing on the
Benghazi attack that resulted in the murders of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and
three other Americans, observes <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">But Katie Pavlich, writing on the <em>Townhall.com</em> website, noted, “The
majority of Democrats on the committee left the room and refused to listen to
the testimony of Patricia Smith and Charles Woods. Ms. Smith is the mother of
Sean Smith, an information management officer killed in the 9/11 Benghazi
attack. Charles Woods is the father of Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who was also
killed.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>That
resulted in most of the far side of the room, where Democrats sit, becoming
empty.&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Pavlich added the only Democrats who stayed were Elijah
Cummings, ranking member from Maryland, and California Rep. Jackie
Speier.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Seventeen Democrats are on the committee.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span></p>

film and TV production company, Playtone, to create a 10-part documentary on

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In print action:</strong> T<em>he Kiplinger Letter</em>, which calls
itself the most widely read business forecasting periodical in the world, is <strong>marking</strong> <strong>its 90<sup>th</sup> year of weekly economic and political predictions</strong>.&#0160; Spokesperson Jessica Weeg said the

                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">Russian President Vladimir Putin got a solid assist from U.S. public
relations giant Ketchum Inc. in placing his commentary in <em>The New</em> <em>York Times’</em> op-ed
page Thursday just as a meeting of Russian and U.S. representatives in Geneva, focusing on
Syria and chemical weapons, got under way, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In the op-ed --- titled <strong><em>A Plea for Caution From Russia</em></strong> --- which
grabbed heavy print and broadcast headlines in the U.S., Putin portrayed
himself as a peacemaker, criticized the U.S. and lectured the U.S. for its tendency
to use &quot;brute force&quot; in world disputes.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>R<em>euters</em> pointed out </strong><strong>Ketchum has earned more than $25 million working
for Russia, according to documents filed with the U.S. Justice Department.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The PR firm, with 74 offices and 56 affiliates in 70 countries, is a
unit of New York Stock Exchange-listed Omnicom Group Inc.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Several sources said Putin himself wrote the op-ed.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">On the day the op-ed appeared, a Senate panel
narrowed the definition of a “covered journalist” as
an independent contractor, employee or agent of an entity that disseminates
news or information. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">So, as
the writer of an op-ed piece, does that put Putin (as a “freelance writer”) in
the same category as other contributors to <em>The
New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, </em>the<em> Los Angeles Times </em>and other publications?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">Meanwhile, in a “fair and balanced” response to Putin’s
<em>N.Y. Times</em> material, Sen.
John McCain (R., Ariz.) will write an op-ed for Russia’s <em>Pravda, </em>with a paltry paid circulation of 49,000, dwarfing that of
the <em>N.Y. Times&#39;&#0160;</em>&#0160;total
circulation of 1.9 million.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>More
snooping looms:&#0160; credit card
transactions</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Overlooked Friday and over the weekend by most media ---
but not the <em>Washington Examiner</em> ---
was information on more government snooping, finds<strong> Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The newspaper declared, “Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau officials are seeking to monitor four out of every five U.S. consumer credit card
transactions this year, up to 42 billion transactions, through a controversial
data-mining program, according to documents obtained by the <em>Washington
Examiner</em>.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong><em>The Washington Examiner</em></strong><strong> went on to
explain that “a CFPB strategic planning document for fiscal years 2013-17
describes the ‘markets monitoring’ program through which officials aim to monitor
80 percent of all credit card transactions” this year.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“The
U.S. Census Bureau reports that 1.16 billion consumer credit cards were in use
in 2012 for an estimated 52.6 billion transactions. If CFPB officials reach
their stated ‘performance goal,’ they would collect data on 42 billion
transactions made with 933 million credit cards used by American consumers.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">What&#39;s more, the
newspaper added, “CFPB officials hope to monitor up to 95 percent of all
mortgage transactions, according to the planning document.”</span></p>

It marks the 21<sup>st</sup> journalist to become a member of the Obama
administration…While Washington and most media have been focusing on Syria and
chemical weapons, <strong>North Korea has been
acting up --- again</strong>.&#0160; The <em>Associated Press</em> reported a&#0160;recent
satellite image appears to show the communist country is restarting a plutonium
reactor in a move that could raise renewed international alarm over its nuclear
weapons program, according to the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Ice story ignored
by most U.S. media:</strong> &#0160;A chilly Arctic summer has left nearly <strong>a million more square miles of ocean
covered with ice than at the same time last year,</strong> reports Britain’s <em>Daily Mail</em>.&#0160; That’s a 60 percent increase.&#0160; The newspaper noted the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to
the Pacific has remained blocked by pack-ice all year, adding <strong>global warming has &quot;paused&quot; since</strong> <strong>early 1997</strong>, “an event that the computer
models used by climate experts failed to predict.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In media

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Overlooked by media in the current heavy coverage
of the U.S. preparing for possible military action against Syria is that just a
month ago the Pentagon proposed deep cuts in the size of the already slimmed-down
Army and Marine Corps, reminds <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong>.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">With thousands of troops stationed in
Afghanistan, Iraq, South Korea, Japan and Germany, among other&#0160;locations,
Pentagon officials in early August announced they would cut at least 40,000
soldiers --- that’s equal to almost <em>three
Army divisions</em> --- in efforts to shrink to 490,000 troops.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Furthermore,
in some scenarios, the Army could dwindle to 380,000 members, added Pentagon
officials.</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">This certainly would put the U.S. in a bind if
conflicts broke out in the Middle East, Asia or elsewhere.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">President Barack Obama, in pushing for military
action against Syria, has been repeating the line that Syria “threatens our
national security interests.”&#0160; At a
Wednesday news conference in Sweden, he declared he could order strikes against
Syria even if Congress doesn’t authorize them.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">More on which direction looms comes today when Obama is interviewed by six TV network anchors. &#0160;Then the president addresses the nation tomorrow night.&#0160;</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Are
media fuzzy on why news jobs fade?</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“Newspapers that were once
mighty fortresses of truth, justice and the American Way are either no more or
shells of their former selves,” wrote Sherman Frederick, a columnist for <em>Stephens Media</em>, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In reminding that “thousands of
newsroom employees have lost their jobs,”&#0160; Frederick cited the recent case of a
political reporter at the <em>Rochester (N.Y.)</em>&#0160; <em>Democrat
and Chronicle</em> who was covering President Barack Obama&#39;s visit when she was
laid off in mid-story.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>“It makes you wonder why more journalists in America do not get
the Obama connection,” he pointed out.</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“What I am saying,” he continued,
“is that had Obama not done such a bad job of guiding the nation back from the
recession, many of these jobs could have been saved. Had Obama just been an
average president when it comes to the economy, we would have been back on our
feet by 2011.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“It&#39;s 2013 and I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re
out of the soup yet.”&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile, just last week Jeff
Bezos, Amazon.com founder and chief executive who is buying the <em>Washington Post </em>for $250 million, said
the newspaper --- which has reduced staff in recent years --- would be rendered
obsolete if it continued to cut its payroll.<strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Another periodic Golden State “scare” story --- <strong>Tsunami Would Batter California Economy </strong>---
received heavy treatment in the state’s print and broadcast media.&#0160; The U.S. Geological Survey and others
said<strong><em>
IF</em></strong> a monster earthquake struck off
Alaska&#39;s coast, <strong>tsunami waves</strong> <strong>would rush toward California</strong>, swamping
the large Los Angeles-Long Beach ports complex, among other areas, causing billions
of dollars in losses…<em>NewsBusters</em> pointed out that with <strong>this</strong> <strong>week’s&#0160;</strong><strong>one-year
anniversary of the Sept. 11 Benghazi terrorist attack</strong>,&#0160;<em>NBC Nightly News</em>&#0160;anchor
Brian Williams conducted an exclusive interview with White House National
Security Advisor Susan Rice “and completely ignored the topic”…<em>Slate, New Republic </em>and <em>Mother Jones</em> <strong>declared they no longer will use</strong> <strong>“Redskins”&#0160;</strong>(in identifying Washington Redskins) in print,
feeling the name (of the football team since 1933) is considered an offensive
racial slur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Talkers Magazine</em> tomorrow on the Internet launches <em>TalkersRadio </em>that will serve as <strong>a laboratory for new concepts and talk
talent</strong>.&#0160; It can be heard at the
trade publication’s Web site, www.talkers.com…In other broadcast news, Buffalo,
N.Y. radio station <em>WWKB</em> dumped its
liberal talk lineup for sports, utilizing <em>ESPN
Radio </em>programming…<em>ABC News</em>
shuttered its Sacramento bureau…<strong>Actor </strong><strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> will host&#0160;“<em>Up Late With Alec Baldwin”</em>&#0160;at 10 p.m.,
Eastern,&#0160; Fridays on <em>MSNBC</em> starting next month.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Bad report card:</strong>&#0160; Only seven percent of likely U.S. voters think Congress is
doing a good or excellent job, according to a new <em>Rasmussen Reports</em> survey.&#0160;</span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Emphasized with great effect
during World War II, the &quot;loose lips sink ships&quot; slogan apparently was nowhere to be remembered last week when the
White House announced what used to be considered hush-hush details ahead of planned military action in Syria, observes <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Looks like the Pentagon also had a fuzzy memory
of that slogan created by the&#0160;War Advertising Council and promoted by the
U.S.&#0160;Office of War Information during WWII years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“Loose lips sink ships” was designed to prevent
inadvertent disclosure of important information to the enemy. &#0160;That included plans on a pending attack, when, targets and duration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Among items aimed at citizens and military
personnel:</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Don&#39;t mention plans and
forecasts or orders for future operations, whether known or just your guess.</strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Don&#39;t disclose movements
of ships, naval or merchant, troops, or aircraft.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Now, more than seven decades later, the White
House in a mid-week announcement remarkably revealed a U.S. military attack on Syria could
begin as early as last Thursday and consist of two or three days of missile
strikes.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"> The planned action was to
“protect our national security interests,” explained the White House, adding
the push for military action was to punish Syria for what the U.S. said was a
chemical weapons attack.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The U.S. also alerted Syria that five cruise missile-carrying Navy destroyers (plus identifying the ships by name)&#0160;were
positioned in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ready to go.&#0160; Likely military targets were named --- giving additional advance word
so that Syrian military assets could be moved or hidden.</span>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Later in the week the U.S. destroyers were
joined by a U.S. amphibious assault ship, also named, carrying about 300
Marines, although word out of Washington was that there would be no boots on
the ground.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Military action then was shelved Saturday when President
Barack Obama said he would seek congressional
authorization before ordering any strikes in Syria.&#0160; But House and Senate members won’t
return from their traditional summer recess until next Monday.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">For those, including some in Washington, who
missed World War II history, D-Day --- the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944
--- was carried out without advance word leaking out from Washington, the
military or civilians, <em>including members of the press</em>.&#0160; That would be unheard of today.</span>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Location of the landing and military assets
involved were a heavily guarded secret --- because <em>loose lips sink ships.</em></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">How big was that 1944 invasion?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">About 5,000 vessels transported 150,000 men and
30,000 vehicles across the English Channel from Britain to French beaches.</span>&#0160;&#0160;<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">It also involved six parachute regiments ---
13,000 troops flown from nine British airfields in about 800 aircraft, while
300 other aircraft dropped bombs on coastal Normandy.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;And not a word leaked out in advance.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>PETA
has bad news for female chicken eaters.</strong>&#0160; Philadelphia’s <em>KYW-TV</em>, also&#0160;known as <em>CBS
3</em>, uncovered this aimed at women: &#0160;&quot;Eating chicken parts --- or, more
specifically, chicken wings --- <strong>could shrink your baby’s man parts.</strong>&quot; &#0160;It cited a letter from People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA) that
claimed, “The latest scientific evidence shows that the sons of pregnant women
who consume chicken are more likely to have smaller penises because of a
chemical found in the birds’ flesh.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In editing news:</strong> &#0160;Grammarly, an
automated proofreader and grammar checker, <strong>zeroed in on spelling,
grammar and punctuation errors</strong> in articles among
top women&#39;s and men&#39;s magazines.&#0160;
It found most accurate publications for women were <em>Ladies’ Home Journal </em>in top spot, followed by <em>Glamour, O: The</em> <em>Oprah
Magazine</em> and <em>Family Circle</em>.&#0160; For men, <em>GQ </em>ranked No. 1, followed by <em>Popular
Mechanics, Maxim</em> and <em>Playboy</em>…<strong>Quieter assignment in
newsroom:</strong>&#0160; David Colker switched from an assistant business editor at the&#0160;<em>Los Angeles Times </em>to the obituary staff where he will write
and edit obits.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Movies&#39; negative impact on viewers:</strong>&#0160; A new <em>Rasmussen Reports</em> survey found <strong>50 percent of adults figured the
movie industry has a negative impact on American society,</strong> while 21 percent said
the industry has a positive impact, 15 percent maintained it has no impact, and
13 percent were undecided…Boston radio station <em>WBZ </em>reported a South Boston condo owner was <strong>fined $25 a day for
violating association rules by flying the U.S. flag in his window</strong>.&#0160; Condo association rules allowed only white
curtains to hang from windows.&#0160;
Fellow residents (obviously not patriotic) complained.</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">Periodically, especially during dry years, such as 2013, thirsty-for-stirring-things-up
media put the spotlight on how less Colorado River water looms for the Southwest
--- especially the growing Las Vegas area --- and certain steps will have to be
taken to limit usage, observes <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>But what is not
emphasized is that the whole state of Nevada, not just Las Vegas, sips only 3
percent of the Colorado River water released from Lake Mead while a foreign
country, Mexico, siphons five times more from the same source.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The water also is shared by six other states:&#0160; Arizona, California, Colorado, New
Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.&#0160; Mexico
was included via a treaty way back in the 1940s.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">So it’s not unusual to read predictions such as “without
dramatic and wide-ranging action, population growth and climate change will
overwhelm the Colorado River within 50 years.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">It’s natural for dry periods to alternate with wet seasons.&#0160;</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>With the latter, when
there are large spring-summer runoffs from heavy snowfalls in western mountains, very little “water pinch” rhetoric emanates from media.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">If water supply is of such concern, then perhaps the
decades-old treaty with Mexico should be renegotiated to reflect population changes
in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Keystone XL pipeline
hits another federal bump</strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>
notes the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, long in the works, now is sidelined by
the Interior Department that is concerned on effects mainly on wildlife.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The pipeline would extend 1,700 miles from Canada’s oil
sands to Texas Gulf Coast refineries and create thousands of jobs while cutting
U.S. reliance on imported oil.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">As pointed out by <em>Los
Angeles Times </em>writer Neela Banerjee last week, a 12-page April 29 Interior
Department letter, but posted mid-August, <strong>“grimly
</strong><strong>catalogs many ways Keystone XL could harm
wildlife: ‘species displacement, increased predation rates and predator travel
lanes, increased nest parasitism, vehicle collisions with wildlife…invasive
plant species, increased wildfire risk, lower wildlife density, increase in
collisions with power lines and electrocutions on power poles … and increase in
poaching.’”</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">(Sounds almost like what happens daily along Los Angeles freeways.)</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The Interior Department comments contradict the State Department’s
March draft environmental assessment, which concluded the project would have
only a temporary, indirect impact, noted Banerjee.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>The Times</em> writer also
mentioned: “The State Department could issue its final environmental impact statement
at any time. The Obama administration must then determine whether the pipeline
serves the national interest, based not just on the State Department&#39;s
analysis, but those of other federal agencies, too, such as the EPA and the
Interior Department.”</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you
missed these…</strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Publishing
items:&#0160; Other publications must be
drooling at the <em>WSJ.</em></strong><em> </em><strong>monthly magazine</strong> for September,
which is packed with ritzy ads.&#0160;
With 160 pages, readers don’t get to the list of editorial contents
until&#0160;page 37…<strong>Koch Industries Inc.
over the weekend ended speculation</strong> on buying the <em>Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune</em> or other <em>Tribune Co.</em> newspapers.&#0160;
Brothers Charles and David Koch say they are no longer interested.&#0160; <strong>This
must have brought relief to some <em>L.A.
Times</em> staffers who earlier vowed to quit if the billionaire brothers took
over.&#0160; </strong>Name mentioned now is
Rupert Murdoch, <em>News Corp</em>. chairman,
who has expressed interest in the <em>L.A.
Times</em> with its closeness to the entertainment business…A large group of
Egyptian protesters, opposing the Muslim Brotherhood, gathered in front of the <em>Washington Post</em> Thursday, temporarily
shutting down the main lobby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>With Army
soldier Bradley Manning sentenced to 35 years in prison</strong> Thursday for
leaking 700,000 classified military and diplomatic documents over seven months
in 2010, <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong> finds it <strong>strange that not one newsperson asked how a
22-year-old private first class (with one stripe on sleeves), could be placed
in the sensitive position of intelligence analyst.</strong>&#0160; Manning last week announced he replaced
his first name with Chelsea and intends to live as a female…<strong>W<em>alt
Disney Co.</em> plans to lay</strong> <strong>off
about 175 people</strong> in its <em>Disney/ABC

Angeles Dodgers broadcast booth in 2014</strong> for his 65<sup>th</sup> season with

House speaker and Republican presidential candidate <strong>Newt Gingrich will be one of the hosts on <em>CNN</em>’s revived half-hour political debate show, <em>Crossfire,</em></strong> which restarts on Sept. 16.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>While most media
have become silent on IRS and Benghazi scandals, on Thursday they jumped to
write or air material on the <em>40-year-old
Watergate event</em>&#0160;based on additional Richard Nixon tapes.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">It took two months to halt
shipments of prepackaged salad mix that brought 576 cases of cyclospora to 19 states, at last count by the federal Centers for
Disease Control through Thursday, notes Grumpy Editor.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The outbreak started in Iowa
and Nebraska before spreading to 17 other states:&#0160; Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York (including
New York City), Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Medical writers, essential staffers at one time before
newsroom cuts became routine, probably could have cracked source and
distributor in a matter of days.</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">First cases of cyclospora ---
a single-celled parasite often associated with
contaminated fresh produce --- turned up in early June.&#0160; Shipments of Mexican-grown Taylor Farms
salad mix were halted Aug. 9.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Reports circulated that some
restaurant chains served the contaminated salad mix. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Cyclospora symptoms can take
several days or weeks to appear and include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, nausea
and stomach cramps.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>J-school grads take 6-8 months to land jobs</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">It’s been a tough time for
journalism graduates to line up jobs pronto.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">A University of Georgia’s Grady
College survey found about 66 percent of 2012 journalism graduates took six to
eight months after graduation to line up full-time positions.&#0160; That was up from 62 percent in the
prior year.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>The J-school graduates were going
into a market where thousands of newsroom jobs have been slashed at both large
and small publications.&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“Employers might be shedding senior-level jobs, but
there’s always pressure to hire entry-level jobs,” said Lee Becker, University
of Georgia journalism professor and co-author of the report. He noted there was
an increase in start-up online publications.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The median salary for new hires hasn’t
been earth-shaking:&#0160; $32,000 in
2012, edging up from $31,000 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Celebrity scandals or Egypt riots?</strong>&#0160; A
new <em>Rasmussen Reports</em> national survey
found 81 percent of Americans think fellow <strong>Americans pay too much attention to
celebrity news and not enough attention to other developments</strong> that have real
impact on their lives.&#0160; In allied
action, <em>Rasmussen</em> tallied 58 percent of those
surveyed, when given the choice, <strong>preferred to read printed versions of newspapers
rather than online material</strong>, while 29 percent gave the nod to online versions
of papers --- and 12 percent were undecided.&#0160;&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Rick Folbaum</strong>,<strong> from <em>Fox News Channel</em>,</strong> joined Miami’s <em>WFOR-TV</em> (known as <em>CBS4</em>) as co-anchor of the station’s weeknight 5 and 11 newscasts. &#0160;He goes on air next Monday…Also in Miami, demolition is under way at the <strong>former Miami
Herald headquarters</strong> by the Genting Group which paid nearly $240 million for the
site on Biscayne Bay.&#0160; Genting
plans a condominium and hotel project on the property and is seeking approval
to incorporate a casino…<strong>Sports makes way for classical music</strong>&#0160;beamed from

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Two U.S. senators, without meteorological or scientific
backgrounds, have grabbed chunks of print space with their “expert” comments on
climate change, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) in the <em>Las Vegas</em> <em>Sun </em>opinion page yesterday declared, “There should be no doubt:
Climate change is contributing to&#0160;wildfires in the West and causing them
to be more ferocious, frequent and devastating.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">He pointed out 28,000 acres recently burned in the
mountains west of Las Vegas. </span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">But he did not mention that wildfire was
started by a lightning bolt, and U.S. acres burned this year through
mid-July ranked second lowest for
the like period over the past decade, (according to a tally by National
Interagency Fire Center).</span>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Reid, who co-hosts a Las Vegas gathering tomorrow on
clean energy, said extreme weather will be one of the issues to be discussed and
“how clean energy investments can make communities more resilient to such
weather.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), in the wake of a
wildfire that burned 19,000 acres near Palm Springs, also puts the blame on
climate change --- but also indicated budget cuts are limiting resources to
fight such blazes.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">(She did not mention that budget cuts are man made.)</span></em></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Many
say news reports often inaccurate, finds Pew</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Outside of the media’s role of watchdog, 67 percent of
those surveyed by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press say news reports are often inaccurate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Pew Research also finds 76 percent of those surveyed say news organizations tend to favor one side while 75 percent mention media often
are influenced by powerful people and organizations</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Ratings of news organizations have declined steadily
since Pew Research first began tracking attitudes in 1985.&#0160;Many current ratings
stand near all-time lows reached in 2011.</span>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">For 69 percent of those surveyed, television remains the
top news source. This compares with 28 percent who prefer newspapers and 23 percent who tune in
to radio as their main source.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“The current media landscape is starkly different than
in 2001, when 45 percent said newspapers were their main source for news,” relates
Pew.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>With TV:</strong>&#0160; Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus
threatens to pull <em>NBC </em>and <em>CNN</em> access to the 2016 Republican
primary debates unless those networks shelve their recently-announced <strong>Hillary Clinton film projects</strong>.&#0160; Priebus says if the networks fail to
pull those films by Wednesday’s RNC summer meeting, he will &quot;seek a
binding vote of the RNC stating that the committee will neither partner with
you in 2016 primary debates nor sanction primary debates which you sponsor”…John
Seigenthaler Jr., remembered for his 11 years at <em>NBC</em>, joins the new <em>Al-Jazeera
America</em> network as <strong>a prime-time news
anchor of the network&#39;s nightly prime-time show </strong>to be broadcast from New
York.&#0160; When it launches
Aug.&#0160;20, <em>Al-Jazeera America</em> will
have bureaus in a dozen U.S. cities…<strong>Bad
TV day:</strong>&#0160; A news crew
from San Francisco’s <em>KGO-TV</em> and its
security guard were greeted in Oakland mid-afternoon last week by three men,
one with a gun, who ran off with camera equipment…<strong>J</strong><strong>ay Leno’s
final “Tonight”</strong> <strong>show</strong> on <em>NBC</em> will be on Feb. 6.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">On the heels
of the recent Internal Revenue Service scandal, small business owners in the U.S. are <strong>receiving letters from the IRS questioning
the reporting of their cash income.</strong> Some lawmakers and business owners say
the move is alarming…Maybe the IRS seeks additional funds for this:&#0160; The <strong>U.S.&#0160;government needs an estimated $1.7 billion annually to keep
up 6,700 empty and 71,000 underused buildings,</strong> reveals <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>…After cutting newsroom staffers, the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em> now publishes a
free-standing business section only on Sundays…AccuWeather&#0160;introduces <strong>a 45-day (that’s
right, a month and a half) weather forecast</strong> offered free-of-charge on <a href="http://Accuweather.com/">Accuweather.com</a>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">Speaking of weather --- and illustrating hot summer days --- rather than
the usual U.S. beach, sailing or kids running through sprinklers shots, <em>Associated Press</em> last week transmitted a
photo (used by U.S. editors, no less) of children cooling off via <strong>water in a park --- in Bucharest, Romania.</strong></span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Team climate change with a likely increase in future
violence and news editors at major print/broadcast media go bananas, finds <strong>Grumpy Editor.</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Grabbing chunks of newspaper space and radio/TV airtime
Friday and into the weekend were mentions that shifts in climate --- even
relatively minor departures from normal temperatures --- <em>could</em> significantly
increase human conflicts around the world by 2050, according to a study by
researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Princeton
University.&#0160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Solomon Hsiang, the study’s lead author, is described as a
postdoctoral fellow in science, technology and environmental policy at
Princeton during the research project and now is an assistant professor of
public policy at UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Most print/broadcast news outlets did not identify Hsiang
other than “lead author,” although <em>Associated
Press</em> labeled him as an economist.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">What media overlooked was that Hsiang, also as lead author
in a study publicized two years ago, covered much of the same ground with
“often war is associated with global climate change.”&#0160; See him in an Aug. 29, 2011 podcast <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNqNIrX9Odk" target="_self" title="here">here</a></strong>.&#0160; &#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">If future extreme heat is likely to trigger violence, then
violent crime should be rampant now in places such as Palm Springs, Phoenix and
Las Vegas, where temperatures last month soared to (what is considered normal
for the period) 112-118 degrees --- and 100-plus readings continue this week.&#0160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">And Death Valley, where the thermometer reached a world
record --- &#0160;a scorching 134 <em>degrees --- <strong>a century ago</strong></em> (July 10, 1913, to be exact), should be the
shootout capital of the world.&#0160;
However, readings at the California tourist site “cooled down” in recent days from 128 degrees on July 3 and 129 degrees on June 30.&#0160; The temperature reached only 112
degrees there on Friday.&#0160; No recent
crime sprees were reported.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Most
July job growth comes via part-time work</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">While most media trumpeted the July government employment report
released Friday as adding 162,000 positions (and
not mentioning the number was below economist expectations of 184,000), Kevin
G. Hall, at McClatchy’s Washington bureau, went a step further to point out:&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">A closer&#0160;look at the Labor Department figures “suggests that
part-time work accounted for almost all the job growth that’s been reported
over the past six months.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">He also worked in quotes from Keith Hall, a senior researcher at George
Mason University’s Mercatus Center and former head of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics:&#0160; “Over the last six
months, of the net job creation, 97 percent of that is part-time work.&#0160; That is really remarkable.”</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The researcher added, “That is a really high number for a six-month period. I’m not
sure that has ever happened over six months before.”&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Plain Dealer dumps
50 newsroom staffers</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In what one news person said was a “graceless” layoff method, <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em> editorial
staffers were told to stand by their telephones on Wednesday, between 8 and 10
a.m., to learn if they got the ax.&#0160;
Fifty did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Others got the green light to go back to the office.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Those getting pink slips were then asked to collect
severance materials the following day --- at the paper’s production center
about 10 miles away from the editorial room.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Ohio’s largest newspaper, owned b y Advance
Publications, in April announced a scale-back in home deliveries to three days
a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile, getting pink slips in other cities were 29
workers at Gannett Co.’s <em>Arizona Republic</em>,
Phoenix, and <em>Chattanooga
Times</em> <em>Free Press</em>
editorial writer Drew Johnson who wrote a headline:&#0160; <strong>&#39;Take your jobs</strong> <strong>plan and shove it, Mr. President: Your
policies have harmed Chattanooga enough.”</strong>&#0160; It appeared over an editorial on Tuesday, the day President Barack Obama visited the city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>With cries for more U.S. jobs, the Pentagon plans
to buy additional <em>Russian-made </em>helicopters
for Afghanistan.&#0160;</strong> The Pentagon has
spent $1.1 billion on the Mi-17 choppers since 2010 and will pay <strong>$350 million
for 15 more of the aircraft</strong>, reported the <em>Wall
Street</em> <em>Journal</em>…Speaking of where
U.S. taxpayers’ money goes,<em> Bloomberg</em>
<em>News</em> reported <strong>President Barack Obama
proposes giving about $323 million in aid next year --- to Columbia</strong>, to combat
drug trafficking and violence in that South American nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Amelia Rose Earhart, weather and traffic co-anchor at
TV station KUSA, Denver, an NBC affiliate owned by Gannett Co., is <strong>finalizing
plans to re-create her namesake and distant relative Amelia Earhart’s legendary
flight</strong> which ended on July 2, 1937, when her airplane vanished on approach to
Howland Island in the western Pacific.&#0160;
With co-pilot Patrick Carter, a Fayetteville, Ark., businessman, KUSA’s Earhart,
30, plans the flight for next summer…<strong>Less on-base magazine purchasing for Army
and Air Force personnel</strong> as Army and Air Force exchanges
worldwide dropped 891&#0160;periodicals ranging from <em>Playboy</em> to <em>Saturday Evening</em> <em>Post --- </em>yes,
even <em>SpongeBob Comics</em>…<em>ESPN</em>
will hire bloggers to cover NFL teams this season.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Lack of investigative reporters?</strong>&#0160; While a wide outbreak of cyclospora, a lengthy intestinal
illness, sickened more than 400 salad eaters in the U.S., media
failed to dig in and seek the source of the tainted pre-packaged veggies, as health
officials stayed unusually mum on the source and label involved.</span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">After a Goldman Sachs market analyst’s comments sent Tesla
Motors Inc. stock down $18.21 to $109.05 a share on July 16, the buoyant electric car maker steadily regained upward movement, capped by a positive outlook Friday from a Deutsche Bank
analyst as the Palo Alto-based auto firm&#39;s stock jumped
$5.32 to $129.39 a share, notes <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">That put Tesla $2.13 above its July 15 close of $127.26, a
day before Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault set a Tesla price target
of $84 a share, sending the auto maker’s stock south.&#0160; (Interestingly, two months earlier Archambault set a price
target of $61.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>On
Friday, Deutsche Bank analyst Dan Galves upgraded Tesla, saying the electric
car maker “has taken a very large step ahead of the competition” and raised his
rating to&#0160;“buy” from “hold.”&#0160;
He boosted his price target to $160 --- about double that of Goldman
Sachs analyst Archambault two weeks ago.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Despite a down market today, Tesla jumped to a new high, up $5.23 to $134.62.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Zig-zag
comments with opposing analysts’ views are what trigger gray hairs on business
writers and investors.&#0160;</em></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Deutsche’s Galves told an <em>Associated Press</em> reporter:&#0160;
&quot;Several unbiased third parties (are) concluding that Tesla&#39;s
first mass-produced vehicle is the best car they&#39;ve ever tested.&#0160; In the eyes of many consumers and
critics, (Tesla has) designed a superior car by taking advantage of the
architectural attributes of an E-vehicle (such as battery placement underneath the
floor of the vehicle), and using this to (the company’s) advantage (i.e. better
handling, quietness, storage, interior volume).&quot;</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>KC
Star sees ‘gusto’ in Obama speech</strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">While many in the media cited President Barack
Obama’s&#0160;on-the-road speeches at two college campuses last week as recycled
material --- although it included new remarks on “phony scandals” (such as
Benghazi, IRS, and NSA spying) --- the <em>Kansas
City Star</em> saw some nuggets that inspired an editorial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The <em>Star</em> noted
glowing pluses in the president’s comments for middle class folks.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>“Obama
left the naysayers behind and pledged to spend the rest of his time in office
fighting to improve the lives of the middle class,” read the <em>Star</em> editorial. &#0160;“He did so with gusto.”</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The editorial in the McClatchy Co.-owned newspaper also
beamed, “His template is consistent, reasonable and refreshingly positive:&#0160; access to quality education from
preschool to college, infrastructure upgrades, good paying jobs, home
ownership, secure retirements and affordable health care.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The <em>Star</em>’s daily
circulation, as of a March 31 tally by Alliance for Audited Media, was
189,283.&#0160; That compares with
weekday circulation of 206,441 in September, 2010.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>NBC plans a
Hillary Rodham Clinton miniseries</strong> timed to precede the 2016 presidential
election. &#0160;It’s linked to the
network’s effort to create &quot;event&quot; programming.&#0160; Diane Lane is set to&#0160;portray the
former first lady and secretary of state...<strong>More Hispanic adults are</strong> <strong>consuming news in
English</strong> from television, print, radio and Internet outlets, according to a
Pew Research Center survey.&#0160; It
found 82 percent said they get at least some of their news in English, up from
78 percent six years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Bank
PR problem:</strong>&#0160; First
National Bank of Wellston (Ohio) has a very irritated female in its
community.&#0160; <strong>The two-office bank foreclosed on the wrong house</strong> --- which
happened to be hers.&#0160; With the
action, out went her belongings, with most hauled away, some sold, others
trashed…In another problem --- the type that shakes up PR folks --- when&#0160;<strong>San Diego Mayor Bob Filner</strong> held a press
conference Friday to announce he was undergoing two weeks of counseling, his
microphone went dead soon after he started talking.&#0160; It was out for about 10 minutes while about two dozen print
and broadcast staffers anxiously waited (they expected him to resign).&#0160; <em>MSNBC,
Fox News</em> and <em>CNN</em> anchors, some
depending on a feed from<em> KFMB</em> in San
Diego, had to ad lib during the blank period. Meanwhile, a next-day <em>Associated Press</em> story <strong>identified Filner as a Democrat --- in the
eighth paragraph.</strong>&#0160;</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">Media’s quest in seeking input from (not heard from) survivors of the
Benghazi, Libya, terror attack that killed four Americans last September
continues to be hampered by a solid block wall, finds <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The <em>Weekly Standard’s</em> Daniel Halper reports Congressman Frank
Wolf (R., Va.) on the House floor Thursday said survivors of the Benghazi
attack have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>&#0160;&quot;According
to trusted sources that have contacted my office, many if not all of the
survivors of the Benghazi attacks along with others at the Department of
Defense, the CIA have been asked or directed to sign additional non-disclosure
agreements about their involvement in the Benghazi attacks,” writes Halper.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“Some of these new NDAs, as they call them, I have been told were signed
as recently as this summer.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Wolf, adds Halper, noted the <em>Marine Corps Times</em> reported the
Marine colonel whose task force was responsible for special operations in
northern and western Africa at the time of the attack is still on active duty
despite claims that he retired…and therefore could not be forced to testify
before Congress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The maneuvers, mentions Wolf, raise “serious concerns about the priority
of the administration&#39;s efforts to silence those with knowledge of the Benghazi
attack in response.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Marine in
Taliban case plans to write book</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">Sgt. Joseph Chamblin, a 15-year Marine veteran who was fined and
demoted for urinating on Taliban corpses in Afghanistan two years go, says he
would do it again, writes Kristina Wong in <em>The Washington Times</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Furthermore, he plans to retire in September --- and write a book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Does he regret what he did?&#0160; “Hell, no,” barks Chamblin.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>The infamous
incident became international news after a video was uploaded to <em>YouTube</em>.
It led to courts-martial of nine Marines for the episode.</strong><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Chamblin was on a mission to stop Taliban insurgents from making
roadside bombs, the kind that killed a member of his sniper team days before
the incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>In case you missed
these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">At least five retailers --- all with strong New England
ties --- have <strong>banned selling the current
issue of <em>Rolling Stone</em></strong> with
suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnev on the cover:&#0160; CVS and Walgreens pharmacies, Tedeschi
Food Stores and other grocery chains Roche Bros. and Stop &amp; Shop…<strong>Strange diversification:&#0160; </strong>The <em>Washington Post Co</em>. is acquiring 86-year old Forney Corp., a <strong>global manufacturer of oil and gas burners
for electric utilities.&#0160; </strong>The
company in 1983 expanded abroad by selling burner-management systems and other
products to fossil-fuel-fired plants in China.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Shuttering
operations:</strong>&#0160; Quebec-based <em>Sun Media Corp.</em> is
closing <strong>11 newspapers across Canada</strong>
and eliminating 360 jobs as part of a cost-cutting plan…Three Dayton, Ohio-area community
newspapers are closing Aug. 9 --- the Springboro Sun, the Kettering-Oakwood
Times and the Centerville-Washington Township Times…Lawrenceville,
Ga.-based <em>Southern Community Newspapers
Inc</em>. <strong>closed photo departments</strong> at
five dailies and two weeklies. &#0160;It
will call on its journalists to shoot art and post on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Expanding
with newspapers:</strong>&#0160; Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is adding the <em>Press</em> of Atlantic City, N.J. to its
family.&#0160; The <em>Press</em>, with a daily circulation of 67,000, marks Berkshire’s 31<sup>st</sup>
daily.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>A flood that wasn’t:</strong>&#0160; <em>Associated
Press</em>, in reporting a T-storm that rained on the Las Vegas Strip, said it
amounted to 0.35 <em>inches</em>. &#0160;That seems like a torrent. &#0160;Actually, the correct measurement is 0.35 <em>of an inch</em>.&#0160; That’s about a third of an inch. &#0160;<em>AP</em> is not alone with the &quot;inflated&quot; amount. &#0160;Some news writers often wrongfully tally precipitation totals
under an inch.</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">Will TV viewership of the 2013 Major League Baseball
All-Star Game on Tuesday continue downward or, with some brisk pace and spark,
will video watchers be greeted with action that boosts the rating, wonders <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Last year’s game was the least-watched All-Star Game on
record, drawing 10.9 million viewers, down from 11 million in 2011.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">A key factor triggering yawns and causing viewers to
switch to other channels appears to be the ever-growing relaxed pace of the
game that originated before the American Civil War (1861-1865) as rounders,
played on sandlots.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>The
front-page feature by Steve Moyer in the <em>Wall
Street Journal’s</em> Friday Arena section notes:&#0160; “By WSJ calculations, a baseball fan will see 17 minutes and
58 seconds of action over the course of a three-hour game.”</strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><em>&#0160;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The almost 18 minutes of action, emphasizes Moyer,
includes balls in play, attempts on stolen bases, wild pitches, trotting
batters such as with home runs, pickoff throws and walks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">To those, <strong>Grumpy
Editor</strong> adds other contributions to the game&#39;s slower pace and inaction just
focusing on the batter --- stepping (after a pitch) far out of the batter’s box
(including a circuitous route walking behind the umpire to get back to the
plate), practice swings before and between pitches, spitting, tapping dirt from
shoes, adjusting batting gloves after every pitch and calling time.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Pitchers,
too, slow the game.&#0160; Adjusting cap
after every pitch, long staring in to catchers, walking around the mound and
picking up the rosin bag, and tossing several times to a base,&#0160;hoping to
nail a runner.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Will the pace tick up this year?&#0160; Stay tuned.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">More &#39;Buy America&#39; sought; CNBC: Nevada slips&#0160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">After the June employment report, Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid (D., Nev.), in a news release from his hometown of Searchlight,
Nev., declared, &quot;We need
to continue advancing policies that spur growth and create jobs. It&#39;s time for
Republicans to let go of their failed austerity policies that weigh down our
economy and prevent a speedier recovery. We simply can&#39;t cut our way to
prosperity.&#0160;“</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">A key way to hypo
recovery and boost jobs is by pushing for more American-based jobs.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>While Reid’s staff was preparing his “spur
growth and create jobs” comment, Rob Hotakainen at McClatchy’s Washington
Bureau developed a lengthy story on how the new San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge, set to open in two months, used 43,000 tons of steel --- <em>from China, producing thousands of jobs away
from U.S.&#0160;</em></strong><strong><em>shores.</em></strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><em>&#0160;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Hotakainen mentioned that with 70,000 U.S. bridges
needing repairs, John Garamendi (D., Calif.) wants Congress to pass more “Buy
America” requirements, using more U.S.-made materials and creating more
manufacturing jobs.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">While imported steel (for the Bay Bridge) costs less, added Garamendi, “the
(Chinese) steel had flaws, the welds had flaws and the end result was no money
was saved.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>It
should be pointed out that while the Senate majority leader seeks to “spur
growth and create jobs,” Nevada --- the state Reid represents --- slipped to 46<sup>th</sup>
place from 45<sup>th</sup> last year among “states for business,” reported Scott
Cohn, <em>CNBC</em> senior correspondent.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“The Silver State,” said Cohn, “is still mired in the
housing crisis, with the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. With the
highest unemployment as well, it is no wonder Nevada finishes at the bottom of
our economy category. It also finishes at the bottom for education, and near
the bottom for quality of life and access to capital.”</span></p>

the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict </strong>late Saturday in the George Zimmerman
case in Florida --- and continuing over the weekend and today on <em>MSNBC</em>, <em>CNN</em> and <em>HLN</em> --- <strong>sidetracks </strong><strong>follow-ups
or updates on the Benghazi incident, turmoil in Egypt, fighting in Syria, IRS
scandals, ObamaCare problems and conflicts/inactions in Congress as a long

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Bad PR for journalists:</strong> A <em>Pew
Research Center</em> study finds 27 percent of Americans say<strong> journalists contribute little or nothing to society’s well being.</strong>&#0160; At the top of the list, 78 percent of

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Will soupy ice cream and soggy, unfrozen peas in your freezer
be common in the future as your local utility cuts power on high demand days,
wonders <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>CNSNews.com
---</em>
in material that didn’t get much coverage in major print/broadcast outlets ---
reports, “The Environmental Protection Agency has revised its Energy Star
energy-efficiency requirements for residential refrigerators, and it is
encouraging the inclusion of &#39;connected&#39; features that respond to utility
signals to curb their energy consumption.”</span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>That
means the “connection” allows a power company to regulate appliances&#39;
electricity usage, including curtailing operations during peak demand periods,
such as on hot summer afternoons.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>CNSNews.com</em>, from
an EPA release, points out updated requirements encourage manufacturers of
Energy Star appliances to include optional &quot;connected&quot; features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Revised Energy Star refrigerator-freezer specifications are
slated to go into effect on Sept. 15, 2014.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>China
provides spark for fireworks in U.S.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Since few people, especially
around Fourth of July celebrations, observe the “manufactured in” fine print on
fireworks packages, it comes as no surprise that a new study, via the American
Pyrotechnics Association (APA), finds 93 percent of all
fireworks set off in the U.S. are produced in China.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In reporting this on Friday, the <em>Washington Times</em> notes the U.S. made only
6.7 million of the total 207.5 million pounds of fireworks purchased
domestically last year. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Bethesda, Md.-based APA, as the<strong> </strong>nation’s oldest and most
recognized fireworks trade group, promotes safety in design and use of legal fireworks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160;</span></p>

others have pulled out backing her, the Birmingham, Ala.-based publisher has no plans
to stop printing&#0160;<em>Cooking with Paula Deen</em>, one of eight Hoffman magazines targeted at the women’s market…Chicago-based <em>Tribune Co</em>. <strong>agreed to buy 19
television stations</strong> from <em>Local TV
Holdings</em> in a $2.73 billion deal that boosts <em>Tribune</em>’s television stations to 42…For the first time in four years, <strong>local TV

47-year-old headquarters building on the market</strong> a week after the paper, largest
in New Jersey, threatened to close if union concessions are not met…<em>Al Jazeera America</em> signs <strong>former <em>CNN</em> anchor Soledad O’Brien</strong> and will feature her as a special

Age’s</em> Nancy Hill points out <strong>several global advertisers who spend billions
of dollars in advertising are proposing extended payment terms</strong> --- 75, 90 and up
to 120 days --- for work from ad agencies. &#0160;At the 120-days level, that means output finalized today is paid by
Thanksgiving.&#0160; Standard payment

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">American taxpayers, often facing power outages and steady rate increases
from their local electric utility, are raising eyebrows today following President
Barack Obama --- while on a three-nation tour of Africa --- pledging $7 billion
to bring electricity to more parts of Africa, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The Power Africa project is directed mainly at Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia,
Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Speaking yesterday in Cape Town, South Africa, Obama says the project
would bring electricity to as many as 20 million&#0160;homes and businesses in
sub-Saharan Africa.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Today’s
assignment: &#0160;Survey U.S. media reports,
see if there is mention that U.S. taxpayers would be supporting the $7 billion project
in Africa while at home they are facing higher power bills and, in some cases,
other costs.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In Nevada, for example, a recently-passed state bill calls for NV Energy
to shutter coal-fired power plants and replace them with renewable energy and
natural gas facilities --- <em>with ratepayers
reimbursing the New York Stock Exchange-listed utility for both closing old
power plants and for construction of new ones.</em></span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Newspaper editorial staffers slide continues</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">There were about 2,600 fewer full-time professional editorial jobs at
newspapers last year, a 6.4 percent decline from 2011, leaving that category
with about 38,000 full-time employees, reports the American Society of News
Editors in its annual newsroom census.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The total could be even lower.&#0160;
ASNE points out some large newspapers did not fill out the survey this
year, resulting in missing data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Those include <em>USA Today</em>, the
<em>Los Angeles Times</em>, the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>, the Ariz<em>ona Republic</em>, the <em>Miami Herald</em>, the (New Orleans) <em>Times-Picayune</em>
and several others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In all, 978 of 1,382 dailies responded to the survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Additionally,
notes ASNE, the definition of editorial staff has become muddled as some
newspaper operations maintain regional editing centers. </span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Crossfire </em>will be returning to <em>CNN</em>
in the fall.&#0160; An earlier version
aired for 19 years…At least a dozen <em>Los
Angeles Times</em> editorial staffers received pink slips Friday…<em>The
Star-Ledger</em>, Newark, part of <em>Advance
Publications</em>, warns its 771 workers it <strong>may shut down by the</strong> <strong>end of
the year</strong> if its employee unions don&#39;t make concessions…<strong>Not</strong> <strong>getting much coverage:</strong>&#0160;
<em>CNSNews</em> reports that “the
Internal Revenue Service sent 23,994 tax refunds worth a combined $46,378,040
to ‘unauthorized’ alien workers who <em>all used the same address</em> in Atlanta, Ga.,
in 2011”…In a massive downsizing, the <strong>U.S. Army is slashing the number of active duty combat brigades to 33
from 45. </strong>A brigade usually numbers about 3,500 soldiers, but can
be as large as 5,000 for the heavily armored units…<strong>L</strong><strong>os Angeles</strong><strong> bans
plastic bags used in supermarkets</strong>.&#0160; Patrons have to bring their own reusable bags or pay a dime
for each paper bag.&#0160; (No reports from
environmentalists on concern in the number of trees cut down to supply sudden heavy
usage of sturdy paper bags)…John Shaffer, program director at <em>KDWN</em>, Las Vegas, is named president of the&#0160;Associated Press Television and Radio
Association (APTRA).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">A Bergen County, N.J. couple is facing
a fine (up to $500) after neighbors complained the bird feeder of Alfred and
Annette Rockefeller is attracting too much wildlife. Alfred, 77 and disabled,
says feeding birds is one of his joys.</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">A
Gallup poll finds confidence in U.S. newspapers and television news continues to be
weak, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Confidence
in newspapers slips to 23 percent in the survey earlier this month, not quite
touching the 22 percent level, the low point reached in 2007, and is less than
half the high of 51 percent in 1979.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>TV news clicks up a bit to 23
percent from its low point of 21 percent last year. But that’s far below
confidence at 46 percent reached in 1993.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">What’s
going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Gallup
points out “newspapers and television news had been struggling for years to
figure out how to adjust their strategy for a growing Internet audience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">It
adds growth of social networking sites, including Twitter and Facebook caused “news
outlets and journalists to work to find their place on them.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Gallup notes, “Social sites
and the Internet in general, as well as the 24/7 television news cycle, have
challenged traditional media outlets and brought new ones to the fore, creating
an increasingly complex --- and sometimes messy --- news environment.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">“While
individual news consumers have better access to news and to journalists than
ever before, the struggles of the news industry seem to be affecting Americans&#39;
confidence in it.”</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Cheetos munchers get ‘thanks for participating’</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Is Frito-Lay Inc., Plano, Texas, using a marketing gimmick to
gather personal information on Cheetos munchers?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Frontsides of the orange corn meal snack package now on grocers
shelves proclaim: “You could WIN a one-in-a-minion family adventure to
Universal Orlando.”&#0160; Details on the
backsides.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>There, a crunchy
muncher sees how to “enter for a chance to WIN the ultimate VIP family trip to
Universal Orlando Resort…or thousands of movie tickets to go see <em>Despicable Me 2</em> in theaters.”</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Munchers are instructed to go to a website, enter a nine digit code on
the package and <em>“see if you’ve won movie
tickets or a family trip to Universal Orlando Resort.”</em>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The Frito-Lay buyer enters his/her age and e-mail address.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>But for a muncher
there’s no word on winning the Florida trip or even movie tickets, despite
capital letters on the packaging promising “SEE IF YOU’VE WON.”</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In the Frito-Lay info-gathering process, all one gets is:&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">“YOU&#39;RE ENTERED FOR A CHANCE TO WIN A
ONE-ON-A-MINION ADVENTURE.&#0160; FOR YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY!&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">“THANKS FOR PARTICIPATING.&quot;&#0160;</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">With President Barack Obama’s speech
tomorrow focusing on climate change, and curbing coal-fired power plants, <strong>look
for looming higher</strong> <strong>power bills</strong> if abundant coal is destined for abandonment as low-cost fuel --- <strong>something most
media are reluctant to spell out to budget-squeezed readers/viewers</strong>…Not touched
on in the scant print/broadcast coverage of last week’s Tea Party Patriots-organized
“Audit the IRS” rally at the U.S. Capitol:&#0160; In a vocal three-word message <strong>aimed at U.S. media, thousands chanted
“do your</strong> <strong>job,”</strong>&#0160;relating to covering IRS scandals targeting conservative groups
along with the agency’s upcoming controversial role with ObamaCare.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em><strong>Imagine the TV sports audience for this:</strong> &#0160;Fox Sports</em> dusts off seven-month old <em>high school</em> football footage (a replay from a Pac-5 game between Southern California’s Santa Margarita Eagles vs. El
Toro Chargers) <strong>rather than a live makeup</strong>
<strong>baseball game</strong>&#0160;between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday following the
previous night’s rainout of their New York City game slated for<em> Fox Sports</em> coverage.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em><strong>Newspaper
happenings:</strong>&#0160; Ad Age</em> reports <strong>Pittsburgh is the
best city for a print newspaper</strong>, with 51 percent of people surveyed saying they
read the paper at least once a day…The <em>Boston Globe</em> will <strong>print the full press run of the <em>Boston Herald</em></strong> starting July 1. ..The weekly
<em>Flathead Beacon</em>, Kalispell, Mont., won
top honors among the state’s weekly and small daily newspapers in the Montana
Newspaper Association’s Better Newspaper Contest…London-based <em>Daily Mail</em>&#0160;cycled <strong>a hefty
128,599,300 unique visitors through its website</strong> last month…The
<em>Fauquier Times-Democrat</em>, Warrenton,
Va., says it is <strong>removing Democrat from its title</strong>, making it simply <em>Fauquier Times, </em>&#0160;because &quot;Democrat&quot; in its name
in such partisan political times &quot;is no longer a very astute business
decision.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em><strong>Television
doings:</strong></em>&#0160; Glenn
Beck’s Mercury Radio Arts goes from renting to <strong>purchasing the
72,000-square-foot Irving, Texas studios</strong> serving as headquarters for its TV
and radio productions…New on Saturdays and Sundays starting Sept. 7 from <em>WNET</em>, New York City:&#0160;<em>&quot;PBS&#0160;News Hour

the week and write a column for <em>FoxNews.com</em>…Dan
Abrams, previously an anchor, legal analyst and general manager of M<em>SNBC, </em>is joining <em>ABC</em>’s <em>Nightline</em>&#0160;as an anchor and chief legal affairs

		<div class="entry-content">
                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The much-discussed whereabouts of President Barack Obama
on the night the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked Sept. 11,
2012 popped up again via Roger Ailes, <em>Fox News</em> chairman and CEO, and chairman
of <em>Fox Television Stations Group</em>, notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In receiving a $250,000 award last week from the Bradley
Foundation, Ailes’ acceptance speech included reference to the Benghazi attack
that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including
Ambassador Chris Stephens.&#0160;&#0160; </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>&#0160;<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">“I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t even care what
the president of the United States was doing that night,” Ailes said. “However,
I would like to know what the commander-in-chief was doing that night” ---
which yielded applause from the audience.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile, a photo, presumably shot on Sept. 11, 2012,
resurfaced last week after its first release, without much fanfare, in early
January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The caption read:&#0160;“Denis McDonough, Deputy
National Security Advisor, left, updates the President and Vice President on
the situation in the Middle East and North Africa. National Security Advisor
Tom Donilon and Chief of Staff Jack Lew are at right.”&#0160; All five are standing.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Strangely, Benghazi or Libya are not mentioned
in the caption.&#0160; The photo shows Donilon
holding a red&#0160;file folder.&#0160;
Lew and the president have hands in pockets. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;">However, details are given on the camera used by
official White House photographer Pete Souza: a Canon EOS 5D Mark III.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">See the photo <a href="http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/whitehouse/8341829398" target="_self" title="here">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Obama departed Washington the following morning (Sept. 12) for a Las Vegas
fundraiser.</span></em></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#39;Chained CPI&#39; means less COLA for seniors</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The phrase “chained CPI” and what it is all about made
its debut --- with little comment from most print and broadcast media --- after President
Barack Obama’s budget plan was formally announced on April 10.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">It deals with a proposed change in the formula for
the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) that will negatively affect
millions of&#0160;older Americans receiving Social Security and Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) benefits.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Now, AARP’s CEO is alerting members that if enacted it “means
cutting Social Security benefits by $127 billion over the next 10 years.”</span></strong>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">In a message to members of AARP (formerly known
as American Association of Retired Persons) Addison Barry Rand warns:&#0160; “Can you afford to lose $14,076?,”
pointing out “that’s what the cumulative cut in Social Security benefits will
be for the average retiree by the time they reach 90.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Replacing the traditional consumer price index (CPI), long used in
calculating the annual COLA, by chained CPI will cut yearly benefit increases.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Social Security and SSI recipients grumbled when this year’s COLA
barely rose to 1.7 percent, about half of last year’s 3.6 percent.&#0160;</span>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The chained CPI “is not fair to you, me or other Americans,” declared
Rand in this month’s message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">That caution communication from AARP’s CEO is in
contrast to support of ObamaCare at a November, 2009, press conference when
Rand proclaimed: “AARP is proud to endorse the Affordable
Health Care for America Act.&quot; </span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Sarah
Palin,</strong> former vice presidential candidate, <strong>returns as a <em>Fox</em></strong> <strong><em>News</em> contributor</strong>, appearing today on the channel’s Fox and
Friends…<strong>Despite a presidential visit and
promises of federal assistance</strong>, West, Texas, scene of an April 17
fertilizer plant explosion that killed 15, injured hundreds and destroyed
nearby properties, was <strong>denied funds from

disaster declaration for the town…<em>Al Jazeera America
</em>schedules its <strong>launch for around Aug. 24</strong>...the&#0160;<em>PBS

Brush Jenkins, <strong>one of the few early
female</strong> <strong>photographers</strong> on daily
newspapers (at the original <em>Los Angeles
Daily News</em>), died in Chicago at age 94.&#0160;</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">London-based&#0160;<em>The Guardian</em>&#0160;newspaper left U.S. print/broadcast news media with red faces when it broke stories on Fort Meade, Maryland-based National Security Agency collecting information on millions of Americans through various sources, notes&#0160;<strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Soon followed by the&#0160;<em>Washington Post</em>&#0160;on the NSA activity, it ranks as the top story of the week --- with additional information popping up daily.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Edward Snowden reveals he is the whistleblower behind the leaks.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong><em>The</em></strong><strong>&#0160;<em>Guardian</em>&#0160;describes Snowden as&#0160;</strong><strong>a 29-year-old former technical assistant for the CIA and employee of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, adding he has been working at NSA for the last four years as an employee of various outside contractors, including Booz.</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Now in Hong Kong, Snowden says:&#0160; “I do not expect to see home again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Behind&#0160;<em>The Guardian</em>&#0160;coverage is Glenn Greenwald, a columnist focusing on civil liberties and U.S. national security issues.&#0160; A former constitutional lawyer, Greenwald writes for&#0160;<em>The Guardian&#0160;</em>version designed for the U.S.&#0160;&#0160;<em>The</em>&#0160;<em>Guardian</em>&#0160;maintains a U.S. editorial office (which it calls a branch) in New York City.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Greenwald also was in Hong Kong yesterday.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Breaking the NSA snooping story via London underscores what happens with a decline in U.S. investigative reporters as layoffs mount in print and broadcast media.</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>For an aerial view of NSA’s data center --- showing a half dozen buildings at the vast facility in Bluffdale, Utah --- go <a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/event/image/id/81409/headline/NSA&#39;s%20Utah%20Data%20Center%20in%20Bluffdale,%20Utah" target="_self" title="here">here</a>. &#0160;</em></span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Koch Industries mulls newspaper addition&#0160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&#0160;reports billionaire Charles Koch confirms his company, Wichita, Kan.-based Koch Industries Inc., is looking into the possibility of acquiring newspapers, but insists he is seeking&#0160; a profitable business, rather than a venue to advance his politics.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>&quot;There is a need for focus on real news, not news with an agenda or not news that is really editorializing,&quot; he tells the&#0160;<em>WSJ</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Koch also points out the editorial page of any newspaper his company acquires “would be a marketplace of ideas where all sorts of approaches to public-policy issues are vetted and contrasted, and there could be ongoing debate.”&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Recent reports mention that Koch and his brother David have indicated an interest in Chicago-based&#0160;<em>Tribune Co.</em>&#0160;newspapers, including the&#0160;<em>Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times&#0160;</em>and<em>&#0160;Baltimore Sun.</em>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Getting into the newspaper field would be a new avenue for the Koch brothers.&#0160; Their Koch Industries operations include oil refining, energy pipelines and production of chemicals, fibers and fertilizer.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed these…</strong>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Time Warner Inc.</em>&#0160;is investing about $50 million in China Media Capital, a Chinese investment fund, targeting TV and film content operations…In connection with the June 6 anniversary of the D-Day invasion in France in 1944, some stories reminded readers that&#0160;<strong>World War II veterans are dying at a rate of more than 600 a day</strong>, meaning future tales of combat in Europe and the Pacific are more likely to come from a book or a Website than from the veterans themselves…<strong>Only a very slim one percent of likely voters give Congress an excellent rating,</strong>&#0160;with 64 percent giving the body poor marks while five percent rate performance as good and 26 percent fair, tallies a&#0160;<em>Rasmussen Reports</em>&#0160;survey…Down with “breaking news.”&#0160;&#0160; That’s what Louisville <em>Fox TV</em> affiliate <em>WDRB</em> trumpets.&#0160; “It’s an advertising trick, a gimmick that isn’t based on anything,” declares a voice in a spot the station has been running.&#0160;<strong>“Breaking news’ is seldom actually breaking and, quite often, isn’t even news.”</strong></span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;">Cheers to&#0160;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&#0160;with a humorous play on words with a front-page headline Saturday:&#0160;&#0160;<strong><em>San Francisco Giants Fans Find&#0160;</em></strong><strong><em>Diamonds Are a Gull’s Best Friend.</em></strong>&#0160; The article points out how hungry seagulls “clean up” fans’ food remains after baseball games.</span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>
finds some business writers often jump the gun, saying a company <em>has been sold</em>, when it still --- often
over a period of months --- has to clear shareholder and regulatory hurdles
before the deal is finalized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Such is the case with the announcement that MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., a subsidiary of Warren
Buffett’s <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Berkshire Hathaway">Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</a>, plans to acquire <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:NVE" rel="googlefinance" target="_blank" title="NYSE: NVE">NV Energy, Inc.</a>, for $5.6
billion.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>The pending acquisition needs the approval of NV Energy
shareholders, Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The lengthy procedure for approval could extend
to next year’s first quarter.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Yet, some sources already report a done deal
--- or close to a green light.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The daily <em>Nevada
Appeal</em>, Carson City, says NV Energy <em>“has
been sold”</em> to MidAmerican Energy.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>An <em>Associated Press</em>
report mentions M</strong><strong>idAmerican
Energy “<em>will</em> <em>buy</em> Nevada electric and natural
gas company<em> </em>NV Energy…”&#0160;
(Incidentally, no natural gas is connected with the Nevada power
company.)</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile, Michael Yackira, NV Energy’s president and CEO
informs customers that his company <em>“will
be acquired by MidAmerican.”</em></span>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Fresno
Bee snubs retired veteran staffer’s visit</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Are former newsroom staffers welcomed back to visit where
they once met deadlines?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">After veteran newsman Bill Patterson, now retired, read
an&#0160;<em>Editor &amp;</em>&#0160;<em>Publisher</em>&#0160;story that the&#0160;<em>Pasadena
Star-News</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>San Bernardino Sun</em>&#0160;are inviting the
public to sit back and relax in their newsrooms, he grumbled that wasn’t the
way he was greeted when he attempted to show a friend where he toiled for 42
years at the&#0160;<em>Fresno Bee,&#0160;</em>a<em>&#0160;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.mcclatchy.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="The McClatchy Company">McClatchy Co.</a>&#0160;</em>paper.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>E&amp;P</em>&#0160;mentioned the&#0160;<em>Star-News</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>Sun</em>&#0160;unveiled
“news lounges,” open to the public during business hours, that are equipped
with computers, Internet access, tables and sitting areas.&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong><em>Digital
First Media</em></strong><strong>,
parent of the&#0160;<em>Star-News</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>Sun</em>, opened more than
20 similar &quot;community media labs&quot; around the country, part of a &quot;community engagement initiative.&quot;&#0160;</strong><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Patterson, who drove more than 500 miles to Fresno two
years ago, said he was greeted by a “grouchy receptionist who informed us our
contacts were at lunch and not available,” thus blocking the visit.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Rather than create a fuss, Patterson --- who worked in
just about every part of the&#0160;<em>Bee</em>&#0160;editorial department,
including the City Hall beat, business editor and 20 years covering courts ---
simply departed.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In
case you missed these…</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">The full photo operation, involving about 30 staffers, at
the </span><em style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Chicago Sun-Times</em><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"> (and suburban
subsidiaries) was sacked as </span><strong style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">the tabloid plans to rely on reporters performing double
duty</strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"> in shooting photos and video, along with taking notes.&#0160; The newspaper said, “The </span><em style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Chicago Sun-Times</em><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"> continues to evolve
with our digitally savvy customers, and as a result, we have had to restructure
the way we manage multimedia, including photography, across the network”…</span><strong style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Warren
Buffett&#39;s Berkshire Hathaway was busy last week.</strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">&#0160; In addition to the NV Energy planned acquisition, it said it
will add </span><em style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">The Roanoke (Va.) Times</em><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"> to
its growing list&#0160;of small and medium-sized newspapers.&#0160; With a daily circulation of 76,000 and
Sunday circulation of 90,000, </span><strong style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">it will be Berkshire&#39;s 30th daily newspaper</strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">…<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Veteran

billion dollar government startup loan in a swift three years, a <em>Wall Street
Journal</em> editorial took a swipe at the fast-growing electric car maker,
notes <strong>Grumpy Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Tesla wired a $451.8 million payment to the government on Wednesday. That
sum, coupled with two prior payments, paid off a $465 million loan the company
received from the Department of Energy in 2010 to foster development of
advanced-technology vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The repayment came nine years early.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Despite the prompt
payment (while other companies with recent government loans have defaulted or
are about to) a&#0160;<em>WSJ</em> editorial writer, in giving a bit of history on
the California-based company, decided to “take apart Tesla by the numbers, if
only to give our reader-taxpayers a better sense of what they’ve paid to make
Tesla’s owners rich.”</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Taking up one fourth of the editorial page on Friday, the material cited
subsidies, windfalls, a brokerage report and a <em>Los Angeles Times </em>analysis.&#0160;
It even mentioned an environmentalist who noted “manufacturing and charging
electric cars over their life cycle can produce more carbon than small,
gas-powered vehicles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">The negative editorial was contrary to the hefty applause <em>WSJ</em>’s
auto writer Dan Neil recently gave Tesla after a comprehensive test drive.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>And on Saturday’s <em>The
Journal Editorial Report</em>&#0160;on <em>Fox</em>, Kimberley Strassel, <em>WSJ</em>
editorial board member, praised Tesla in the week’s hits or misses segment,
giving the high-tech auto firm a solid hit in paying off the loan.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Meanwhile, those “rich owners” --- big and small investors of the
publicly-held stock --- gave their answer to the <em>WSJ</em> editorial at the market close on Friday:&#0160; Tesla jumped
$4.35 a share, reaching $97.08, almost four times above its 52-week low.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Magazine hails TV as top creative medium</span></strong></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Catching <strong>Grumpy Editor’s</strong> eyes
was some material in the June issue of <em>Fast
Company </em>that lead off with:&#0160;
“Once a wasteland, TV is now the most thoughtful creative entertainment
medium of them all.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Then it added, “It’s a golden age for TV, where on any given night,
viewers can find multiple examples of American comedic and dramatic genius.”</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Huh?</span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>Sounds like
something that was written in the 1950s, not the current fare that includes easy-on-the-budget reality shows, unfunny comedies peppered with laugh tracks and a parade of
reruns in prime time.</strong></span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">It’s hard to beat the TV menu of the 1950s.&#0160; Among top shows was <em>Playhouse
90</em>, a 90-minute weekly drama series on Thursdays that ran from 1956 to 1960
on <em>CBS</em>.&#0160; <em>Playhouse 90</em> began as a live series, making a transition to
tape in 1957.</span>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">On the comedy side was Sid Caesar’s “Your Show of Shows,” on NBC
from 1950 to 1954. &#0160;The Saturday night “live”
90-minute variety program, which produced genuine laughs, also featured Carl
Reiner and Imogene Coca.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;"><strong>In case you missed
these…</strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 19px;"><strong>&#0160;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,
warning on the Justice Department investigation of Fox<em> News</em> reporter James Rosen, declared:&#0160; <strong><em>&quot;U.S. government efforts to prosecute leakers by obtaining
information from journalists has a chilling effect domestically and sends a
terrible message to journalists around the world who are fighting to resist
government intrusion.&quot;&#0160; </em></strong>Meanwhile,
in connection with the Rosen case and the <em>Associated
Press</em> scandal, Jay Carney, White House press secretary, said:&#0160; <strong><em>The </em></strong><strong><em>president was &quot;a strong
defender of the First Amendment and a firm believer in the needs of the press
to obtain information.&quot;</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino;">While <strong>accused Fort
Hood shooter Major Nidal Hasan has been paid more than $278,000</strong> since the
Nov. 5, 2009 incident that left 13 dead and 32 injured, soldiers wounded in the mass shooting are fighting to receive the same
pay and medical benefits given to those wounded in combat…<em>ESPN</em> is <strong>cutting about 10
percent</strong> <strong>of its work force</strong>…Bob Schieffer, the 44-year <em>CBS
News</em> veteran and moderator of “Face the Nation,” received <strong>the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in
Journalism</strong>…A panel of news and news/talk experts named Hubbard Radio&#39;s <em>WTOP</em>, Washington, D.C., the <strong>U.S.’s top news station</strong> in <em>Radio Ink Magazine&#39;</em>s first listing of
news and news/talk stations…<em>ABC News’</em>
Diane Sawyer and <em>Fox News’</em>
Greta Van Susteren made&#0160;<strong><em>Forbes</em>’
2013 list of the world’s most</strong> <strong>powerful
women</strong>. &#0160;Sawyer ranked No. 73
and Van Susteren No. 97. </span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Young spellers --- perhaps some will be future copy editors --- will be in the spotlight</strong> tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday for the 2013
Scripps National Spelling Bee in National Harbor, Md.&#0160; The Bee, promoted
by <em>E.W. Scripps Co.</em> since 1941,
started in 1925 with nine contestants.</span></p>
