<h1>

Discover the secrets of successful journalism careers


</h1>

<p class="standfirst">An experienced journalist has written a unique ebook answering five years worth of questions he's been emailed through his website.
</p>
<IMG SRC="gfx/jcthumb.jpg" ALT="ebook cover: Journalism Careers: your questions answered" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=285 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT">

<P>Freelance journalist Sean McManus set up a website to promote his work and soon found he was receiving emails from people seeking careers advice. "People would ask me what it's like working as a journalist, or how to get that crucial first break," he says. "Some were students planning for their future careers, but others were people considering a mid-life career change."
<P>"Everyone who wrote to me had one thing in common," he adds. "They all wanted <B>honest</B>, <B>practical advice</B> they could use based on <B>professional experience</B> from someone they could see was successful in journalism."
<p>Now Sean has compiled the <a href="journalismquestions.shtml">64 most frequently asked questions</a> into an ebook, available <B>exclusively </B>at this website.
<p>Read the ebook to discover:
<ul>
<li>How to get published
<li>How to get editors to commission you to write for them
<li>How to negotiate with editors
<li>How to conduct successful interviews
<li>What to study and what skills to acquire
<li>What it's like working as a journalist today
<li>...and much more!
</ul>

<p>
"Reading the ebook is much like being able to sit down with a successful journalist for an hour and ask him all the questions you want," says Sean. "I talk about what it's like being a journalist and offer guidance to help you decide whether you're ready for freelancing. I also give an insight into music journalism. I'll show you how to build up the skills and experience you'll need to land jobs on newspapers and magazines."

<h2>About the author</h2>
<P>Sean McManus was first published in a computer magazine while at school and now has ten years experience researching, writing and editing for business and consumer publications. He has written for several magazines you've heard of (such as Personal Computer World, Marketing Week and Melody Maker) and plenty you probably haven't (including World Highways, Customer Loyalty Today and Bridge design & engineering). He's also the author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0273654861/seanmcmanus" target="_new">Small Business Websites That Work</a> and co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/asin/1903776007/seanmcmanus" target="_new">The Customer Service Pocketbook</a>.
<h2>Improving your pitch</h2>
Sean McManus says: "The careers advice in the ebook will help you when it comes to pitching articles in wide range of industries, whether they are for magazines, newspapers or websites and whether you're interested in music journalism, being a news reporter, working as a magazine editor or being a freelancer."
<p>"These aren't tips on what <em>should</em> work," he adds. "They <em>do</em> work, and <em>have</em> worked for me. My time working in-house editing magazines and my time freelancing contributing to them have given me a valuable insight into why article ideas are rejected and what simple steps people can take to increase their chances of getting published, and paid to write."
