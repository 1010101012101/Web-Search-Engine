      Fiorello Henry LaGuardia (December 11, 1882 - September&#160;20, 1947) was 
      the 99th Mayor of New York for three terms from 1934 to 1945 after 
      having been previously elected to Congress in 1916 and 1918, and again 
      from 1922 through 1930. Irascible, energetic, and charismatic, he craved 
      publicity and is acclaimed as one of the three or four greatest mayors 
      in American history. Only five feet tall, he was called &quot;the Little 
      Flower&quot; (Fiorello is Italian for &quot;little flower&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      LaGuardia, a Republican who appealed across party lines, was very 
      popular in New York during the 1930s. As a New Dealer, he supported 
      President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, and in turn Roosevelt 
      heavily funded the city and cut off patronage from LaGuardia's foes. 
      LaGuardia revitalized New York City and restored public faith in City 
      Hall. He unified the transit system, directed the building of low-cost 
      public housing, public playgrounds and parks, constructed airports, 
      reorganized the police force, defeated the powerful Tammany Hall 
      political machine, and reestablished merit employment in place of 
      patronage jobs.

    <p>
      Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      May God prevent us from becoming &quot;right-thinking men&quot;- that is to say, 
      men who agree perfectly with their own police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pride makes us artificial and humility makes us real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology is not in itself opposed to spirituality and to religion. But 
      it presents a great temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teenagers have no monopoly (on adolescent behavior), except insofar as 
      we are in fact a teenager society- a society that likes to play 
      &quot;chicken,&quot; not with fast cars, but with ballistic missiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, 
      and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the 
      reflection of ourselves we find in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest human temptation is to settle for too little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The least of the work of learning is done in the classrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tighter you squeeze, the less you have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth that many people never understand, until it is too late, is 
      that the more you try to avoid suffering the more you suffer because 
      smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you in proportion 
      to your fear of being hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      To consider persons and events and situations only in the light of their 
      effect upon myself is to live on the doorstep of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are so obsessed with doing that we have no time and no imagination 
      left for being. As a result, men are valued not for what they are but 
      for what they do or what they have- for their usefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the 
      abyss that separates us from ourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      Happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance, order, rhythm and 
      harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole idea of compassion is based on a keen awareness of the 
      interdependence of all these living beings, which are all part of one 
      another, and all involved in one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace demands the most heroic labor and the most difficult sacrifice. It 
      demands greater heroism than war. It demands greater fidelity to the 
      truth and a much more perfect purity of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have to have a deep, patient compassion for the fears of men and 
      irrational mania of those who hate or condemn us.
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting 
      concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit to too many 
      projects, to want to help everyone in everything is itself to succumb to 
      the violence of our times.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have what we seek, it is there all the time, and if we give it time, 
      it will make itself known to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love seeks one thing only: the good of the one loved. It leaves all the 
      other secondary effects to take care of themselves. Love, therefore, is 
      its own reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      When ambition ends, happiness begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot make the universe obey me. I cannot make other people conform 
      to my own whims and fancies. I cannot make even my own body obey me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advertising treats all products with the reverence and the seriousness 
      due to sacraments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to study the social and political history of modern nations, 
      study hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody makes fun of virtue, which by now has, as its primary meaning, 
      an affectation of prudery practiced by hypocrites and the impotent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not meant to resolve all contradictions but to live with them and 
      rise above them and see them in the light of exterior and objective 
      values which make them trivial by comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a glorious destiny to be a member of the human race, though it is 
      a race dedicated to many absurdities and one which makes many terrible 
      mistakes...

      It's surprising what pops up on Google...
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="http://www.kgbreport.com/images/patent.jpg">
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It's U.S. Patent #7,249,057 B2, issued July 24, 2007: &quot;Product 
      Information Supplying Method, Product Information Acquiring Method, 
      Product Information Registering Method And Recording Medium,&quot; and the 
      description is equally enlightening:
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;There is provided a product information supply method for supplying a 
      user who desires to purchase a product with proper information about a 
      related product that could be bought in combination with the product, so 
      that the user is assisted in purchasing products. Registration of 
      combination information to be supplied to the user is made with a 
      database managed by a service provider server by a person who has bought 
      the above product by means of a registration page so that a lot of 
      combination information is accumulated in the database. The registered 
      information includes not only information specifying a combinable 
      product but also information about the effects of the combination and 
      the ways of using products in combination. The database is searched in 
      response to inquiry information from the user who makes reference to a 
      page of products. Thus, corresponding combination information is 
      extracted from the database and is sent to the user.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm no expert in intellectual property law, but- this is something 
      patentable? A database of related products, with the added twist of 
      returning information on &quot;effects of the combination and the ways of 
      using products in combination.&quot; You mean like peanut butter and jelly? 
      Gin and tonic? Water and Alka-Seltzer tablets?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more puzzling is the reference to one of my old DEC Professional 
      DCL Dialogue columns. It deals with referrals and recommendations for 
      computer hardware and software, but its relevance to this patent eludes 
      me. You can read the column <a target="_blank" href="http://kgbreport.com/dcl/199504.txt">here</a>.

      Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took 
      us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in 
      the Middle East that has no oil!
    </p>
    <p>
      Men who have reached and passed forty-five, have a look as if waiting 
      for the secret of the other world, and as if they were perfectly sure of 
      having found out the secret of this.

      Not being beautiful was the true blessing. Not being beautiful forced me

      There's no difference between one's killing and making decisions that

      Whether women are better than men I cannot say- but I can say they are 
      certainly no worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women's Liberation is just a lot of foolishness. It's the men who are 
      discriminated against. They can't bear children. And no one's likely to 
      do anything about that.

      You can get used to anything if you have to, even feeling perpetually

      Willa Sibert Cather (December 7, 1873 - April&#160;24, 1947) was an American 
      author who achieved recognition for her novels of frontier life on the 
      Great Plains, in works such as <i>O Pioneers!, My &#193;ntonia</i>, and <i>The 
      Song of the Lark.</i> In 1923 she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for <i>One 
      of Ours</i> (1922), a novel set during World War I. Cather grew up in 
      Nebraska and graduated from the University of Nebraska. She lived and 
      worked in Pittsburgh for ten years, then at the age of 33 she moved to 
      New York, where she lived for the rest of her life. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willa_Cather"><i>(Click

      Desire is creation, is the magical element in that process. If there 
      were an instrument by which to measure desire, one could foretell 
      achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in harmonious families there is this double life: the group life, 
      which is the one we can observe in our neighbour's household, and, 
      underneath, another- secret and passionate and intense- which is the 
      real life that stamps the faces and gives character to the voices of our 
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give the people a new word and they think they have a new fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to 
      live than other things do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not matter much whom we live with in this world, but it matters 
      a great deal whom we dream of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love itself draws on a woman nearly all the bad luck in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men are all right for friends, but as soon as you marry them they turn 
      into cranky old fathers, even the wild ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men travel faster now, but I do not know if they go to better things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the basic material a writer works with is acquired before the 
      age of fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only solitary men know the full joys of friendship. Others have their 
      family- but to a solitary and an exile his friends are everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the stupid and the phlegmatic should teach.
    </p>
    <p>
      People can be lovers and enemies at the same time, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pittsburgh was even more vital, more creative, more hungry for culture 
      than New York. Pittsburgh was the birthplace of my writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion and art spring from the same root and are close kin. Economics 
      and art are strangers.

    <p>
      Some memories are realities and are better than anything that can ever 
      happen to one again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success is never so interesting as struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead might as well try to speak to the living as the old to the 
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that I was a girl never damaged my ambitions to be a pope or an 
      emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great pines stand at a considerable distance from each other. Each 
      tree grows alone, murmurs alone, thinks alone. They do not intrude upon 
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of another is a dark forest, always, no matter how close it 
      has been to one&#8217;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stupid believe that to be truthful is easy; only the artist, the 
      great artist, knows how difficult it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world is always full of brilliant youth which fades into grey and 
      embittered middle age: the first flowering takes everything. The great 
      men are those who have developed slowly, or who have been able to 
      survive the glamour of their early florescence and to go on learning 
      from life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are only two or three human stories, and they go on repeating 
      themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When kindness has left people, even for a few moments, we become afraid 
      of them, as if their reason had left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When people ask me if it has been a hard or easy road, I always answer 
      with the same quotation, the end is nothing, the road is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is great love there are always miracles.

  Baltasar Graci&#225;n y Morales, SJ (January 8, 1601 - December&#160;6, 1658) was 
  a Spanish Jesuit and baroque prose writer and philosopher. He was born 
  in Belmonte, near Calatayud (Aragon). His proto-existentialist writings 
  were lauded by Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltasar_Graci%C3%A1n"><i>(Click

</p>
<p>
  A man of honor should never forget what he is because he sees what 
  others are.
</p>
<p>
  A single lie destroys a whole reputation of integrity.
</p>
<p>
  A wise man gets more use from his enemies than a fool from his friends.
</p>
<p>
  All victories breed hate.
</p>
<p>
  Be content to act, and leave the talking to others.
</p>
<p>
  Be master over yourself before you would be master over others.
</p>
<p>
  Beauty and folly are generally companions.
</p>
<p>
  Because the ignorant do not know themselves, they never know for what 
  they are lacking. Some would be sages if they did not believe they were 
  so already.
</p>
<p>
  Better mad with the rest of the world than wise alone.
</p>
<p>
  Better to be cheated by the price than by the merchandise.
</p>
<p>
  Complaints will always discredit you. Rather than compassion and 
  consolation, they provoke passion and insolence, and encourage those who 
  hear our complaints to behave like those we complain about. Once 
  divulged to others, the offenses done to us seem to make others 
  pardonable. Some complain of past offenses and give rise to future ones.
</p>
<p>
  Don't take the wrong side of an argument just because your opponent has 
  taken the right side.
</p>
<p>
  Fortune rarely accompanies anyone to the door.
</p>
<p>
  Honorable beginnings should serve to awaken curiosity, not to heighten 
  people's expectations. We are much better off when reality surpasses our 
  expectations, and something turns out better than we thought it would.
</p>
<p>
  Hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one.
</p>
<p>
  If you cannot make knowledge your servant, make it your friend.
</p>
<p>
  Knowing how to keep a friend is more important than gaining a new one.
</p>
<p>
  Many owe their greatness to their enemies. Flattery is fiercer than 
  hatred, for hatred corrects the faults flattery had disguised.
</p>
<p>
  Never compete with a man who has nothing to lose.
</p>
<p>
  Never open the door to a lesser evil, for other and greater ones 
  invariably slink in after it.
</p>
<p>
  Not believing others implies that you yourself are deceitful. The liar 
  suffers twice: he neither believes nor is believed.
</p>
<p>
  Politeness and a sense of honor have this advantage: we bestow them on 
  others without losing a thing.
</p>
<p>
  Readiness is the mother of luck.
</p>
<p>
  Ridicule is the subtlest form of revenge.
</p>
<p>
  Some die because they feel everything, others because they feel nothing. 
  Some are fools because they suffer no regrets, and others because they 
  do.
</p>
<p>
  The beautiful woman should break her mirror early.
</p>
<p>
  The right kind of leisure is better than the wrong kind of work.
</p>
<p>
  There is none who cannot teach somebody something, and there is none so 
  excellent that he cannot be excelled.
</p>
<p>
  Those who insist on the dignity of their office show they have not 
  deserved it.
</p>
<p>
  Those who want to look like hard workers give the impression that they 
  aren't up to their jobs.
</p>
<p>
  To overvalue something is a form of lying.
</p>
<p>
  Trust the friends of today as though they will be the enemies of 
  tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
  Virtue alone is for real; all else is sham. Talent and greatness depend 
  on virtue, not on fortune.
</p>
<p>
  When you counsel someone, you should appear to be reminding him of 
  something he had forgotten, not of the light he was unable to see.
</p>
<p>
  Words are feminine; deeds are masculine.
</p>
<p>
  You should avoid making yourself too clear even in your explanations.

      Nelson Mandela, the former South African president and anti-apartheid 
      icon, died December 5, 2013 following a series of lung infections. He 
      was 95 years old. Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) 
      party in the 1940s and led protests against the ruling apartheid regime, 
      which restricted the basic rights of South Africa&#8217;s nonwhite population 
      and barred their participation in government. His resistance to such 
      oppressive policies earned him nearly three decades in prison, during 
      which he became an international symbol of the anti-apartheid movement. 
      Upon his release in 1990, Mandela helped negotiate an end to the 
      apartheid system, and four years later he won election as the the first 
      black president of South Africa. He retired from politics in 1999, but 
      remained a global advocate for peace and social justice. <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.history.com/news/remembering-nelson-mandela">(Click

    </p>
    <p>
      A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more 
      hills to climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any man that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Difficulties break some men but make others. No axe is sharp enough to 
      cut the soul of a sinner who keeps on trying, one armed with the hope 
      that he will rise even in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a 
      way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not a saint, unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on 
      trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over 
      it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who 
      conquers that fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had my time over I would do the same again. So would any man who 
      dares call himself a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your 
      enemy. Then he becomes your partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It always seems impossible until it's done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lead from the back- and let others believe they are in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, 
      or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if 
      they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more 
      naturally to the human heart than its opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails. A 
      nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens but 
      its lowest ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      One cannot be prepared for something while secretly believing it will 
      not happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things I learned when I was negotiating was that until I 
      changed myself, I could not change others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our march to freedom is irreversible. We must not allow fear to stand in 
      our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too 
      long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, 
      one's feet moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real leaders must be ready to sacrifice all for the freedom of their 
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising 
      every time we fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to 
      pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we 
      reach the mountaintop of our desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must ensure that color, race and gender become only a God-given gift 
      to each one of us and not an indelible mark or attribute that accords a 
      special status to any.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must therefore act together as a united people, for national 
      reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world. Let 
      there be justice for all. Let there be peace for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has 
      no choice but to become an outlaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will achieve more in this world through acts of mercy than you will 
      through acts of retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not an optimist, but a great believer of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must use time wisely and forever realize that the time is always ripe 
      to do right.

      Walter Elias &quot;Walt&quot; Disney (December 5, 1901 - December&#160;15, 1966) and 
      his brother Roy co-founded Walt Disney Productions, which became one of 
      the best-known motion-picture production companies in the world. Disney 
      was an innovative animator and created the cartoon character Mickey 
      Mouse. He won 22 Academy Awards during his lifetime, and was the founder 
      of theme parks Disneyland and Walt Disney World. <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/walt-disney-9275533" target="_blank"><i>(Click

    <p>
      A person should set his goals as early as he can and devote all his 
      energy and talent to getting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our dreams can come true- if we have the courage to pursue them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All you've got to do is own up to your ignorance honestly, and you'll 
      find people who are eager to fill your head with information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Childishness? I think it's the equivalent of never losing your sense of 
      humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do a good job. You don't have to worry about the money; it will take 
      care of itself. Just do your best work- then try to trump it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith I have, in myself, in humanity, in the worthwhileness of the 
      pursuits in entertainment for the masses. But wide awake, not blind 
      faith, moves me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fantasy, if it's really convincing, can't become dated, for the simple 
      reason that it represents a flight into a dimension that lies beyond the 
      reach of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every laugh, there should be a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Girls bored me- they still do. I love Mickey Mouse more than any woman 
      I've ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could never convince the financiers that Disneyland was feasible, 
      because dreams offer too little collateral.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't believe in playing down to children, either in life or in motion 
      pictures. I didn't treat my own youngsters like fragile flowers, and I 
      think no parent should.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a brother who I really envied because he was a mailman. But he's 
      the one that had all the fun. He had himself a trailer, and he used to 
      go out and go fishing, and he didn't worry about payrolls and stories 
      and picture grosses or anything. And he was the happy one. I always 
      said, 'He's the smart Disney.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I have long felt that the way to keep children out of trouble is to keep 
      them interested in things. Lecturing to children is no answer to 
      delinquency. Preaching won't keep youngsters out of trouble, but keeping 
      their minds occupied will.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a mistake not to give people a chance to learn to depend on 
      themselves while they are young.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's kind of fun to do the impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughter is America's most important export.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leadership means that a group, large or small, is willing to entrust 
      authority to a person who has shown judgment, wisdom, personal appeal, 
      and proven competence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is composed of lights and shadows, and we would be untruthful, 
      insincere, and saccharine if we tried to pretend there were no shadows. 
      Most things are good, and they are the strongest things; but there are 
      evil things too, and you are not doing a child a favor by trying to 
      shield him from reality. The important thing is to teach a child that 
      good can always triumph over evil, and that is what our pictures attempt 
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never get bored or cynical. Yesterday is a thing of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a man has tasted freedom he will never be content to be a slave. 
      That is why I believe that this frightfulness we see everywhere today is 
      only temporary. Tomorrow will be better for as long as America keeps 
      alive the ideals of freedom and a better life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The special secret it seems to me is summarized in four C's. They are 
      Curiosity, Courage, Confidence and Constancy. And the greatest of all is 
      Confidence. When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, 
      implicitly and unquestionably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it 
      might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is more treasure in books than in all the pirates' loot on 
      Treasure Island and at the bottom of the Spanish Main... and best of 
      all, you can enjoy these riches every day of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the youngsters of today, I say believe in the future, the world is 
      getting better; there still is plenty of opportunity. Why, would you 
      believe it, when I was a kid I thought it was already too late for me to 
      make good at anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're not trying to entertain the critics... I'll take my chances with 
      the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we do fantasy, we must not lose sight of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why worry? If you've done the very best you can, worrying won't make it 
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be 
      the best thing in the world for you.
