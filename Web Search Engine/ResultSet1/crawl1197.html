The earth is warming up, and there is now overwhelming scientific consensus that it is happening, and human-induced. With global warming on the increase and species and their habitats on the decrease, chances for ecosystems to adapt naturally are diminishing.</p><p>Many are agreed that climate change may be one of the greatest threats facing the planet. Recent years show increasing temperatures in various regions, and/or increasing extremities in weather patterns.</p><p>This section looks at what causes climate change, what the impacts are and where scientific consensus currently is.</p><p class="more">Read “<a href="/article/233/climate-change-and-global-warming-introduction">Climate Change and Global Warming Introduction</a>” to learn more.</p><h2 class="page-intro-title"><a href="/article/802/surveillance-state">Surveillance State: NSA Spying and more</a></h2><p class="page-intro-summary-info">Posted Monday, October 07, 2013.</p><p><img src="http://cdn1.globalissues.org/i/geopolitics/cctv-surveillance-camera.png" alt="" width="150" height="152" class="img-left" /> At the start of June 2013, a large number of documents detailing surveillance by intelligence agencies such as the US’s NSA and UK’s GCHQ started to be revealed, based on information supplied by NSA whistle blower, Edward Snowden.</p><p>These leaks revealed a massive surveillance program that included interception of email and other Internet communications and phone call tapping. Some of it appears illegal, while other revelations show the US spying on friendly nations during various international summits.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there has been a lot of furor. While some countries are no doubt using this to win some diplomatic points, there has been an increase in tension with the US and other regions around the world.</p><p>Much of the US surveillance programs came from the aftermath of the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001. Concerns about a crackdown on civil rights in the wake of the so-called <q>war on terror</q> have been expressed for a long time, and these revelations seem to be confirming some of those fears.</p><p>Given the widespread collection of information, apparently from central servers of major Internet companies and from other core servers that form part of the Internet backbone, activities of millions (if not billions) of citizens have been caught up in a dragnet style surveillance problem called PRISM, even when the communication has nothing to do with terrorism.</p><p>What impacts would such secretive mass surveillance have on democracy?</p><p class="more">Read “<a href="/article/802/surveillance-state">Surveillance State: NSA Spying and more</a>” to learn more.</p><h2 class="page-intro-title"><a href="/article/75/world-military-spending">World Military Spending</a></h2><p class="page-intro-summary-info">Last updated Sunday, June 30, 2013.</p><p>World military spending had reduced since the Cold War ended, but a few nations such as the US retain high level spending.</p><p>In recent years, global military expenditure has increased again and is now comparable to Cold War levels.

With the resulting recession, many governments of the wealthiest nations in the world have resorted to extensive bail-out and rescue packages for the remaining large banks and financial institutions while imposing harsh austerity measures on themselves.</p><p>Some of the bail-outs have also led to charges of hypocrisy due to the apparent <q>socializing of the costs while privatizing the profits.</q> Furthermore, the institutions being rescued are typically the ones got the world into this trouble in the first place. For smaller businesses and poorer people, such options for bail out and rescue are rarely available when they find themselves in crisis.</p><p>Plummeting stock markets at one point wiped out 33% of the value of companies, $14.5 trillion. Taxpayers bailed out their banks and financial institutions with large amounts of money. US taxpayers alone have spent some $9.7 trillion in bailout packages and plans. The UK and other European countries have also spent some $2 trillion on rescues and bailout packages. More is expected. Much more.</p><p>Such numbers, made quickly available, are enough to wipe many individual’s mortgages, or clear out third world debt many times over. Even the high military spending figures are dwarfed by the bailout plans to date.</p><p><a href="/article/768/global-financial-crisis" title="Global Issues: “Global Financial Crisis”, Last updated: Sunday, March 24, 2013"><img class="figure" alt="Taxpayers are paying for some of the largests costs in history" src="http://cdn1.globalissues.org/i/economy/global-financial-crisis-bailout-in-context.png" width="550" height="601" /></a></p><p>This problem could have been averted (in theory) as people had been pointing to these issues for decades. However, during boom, very few want to hear such pessimism.

Yet these super elite are often very influential in politics and business. In effect, they are able to undermine democracy and capitalism at the same time.</p><p>As the global financial crisis has affected many countries, tackling tax avoidance would help target those more likely to have contributed to the problem while avoid many unnecessary austerity measures that hit the poorest so hard.
