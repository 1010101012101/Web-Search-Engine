According to recent reports in the <em>Johannesburg Star</em> and on CBS News, Mr. Mandela was traveling to meet a CIA officer who was working out of the United States Consulate in Durban, the capital of Natal. Instead of attending the meeting, the CIA man told the police exactly where and when the most hunted man in South Africa could be found.&#8221; See from FAIR: &#8220;<a href="http://fair.org/take-action/media-advisories/cia-and-mandela-can-the-story-be-told-now/">CIA and Mandela: Can the Story Be Told Now?

<p>PIERO GLEIJESES, slee255 at jhu.edu<br />
    Gleijeses is a professor of U.S. foreign policy at the <a href="http://www.sais-jhu.edu/piero-gleijeses">Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University</a> and author of several books including the just-released <em><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/190775542/Prologue-from-Visions-of-Freedom-by">Visions of Freedom: Havana, Washington, Pretoria and the Struggle for Southern Africa, 1976-1991</a></em>.</p>
<p>    Asked about the controversy regarding the handshake between Presidents Raul Castro and Barack Obama, Gleijeses said this morning on &#8220;<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/12/11/the_secret_history_of_how_cuba">Democracy Now</a>&#8220;: &#8220;I think it’s pathetic and reflects the ethics of the United States and the policy of the United States. President Obama, was received with applause in South Africa when he spoke because he is the first black president of the United States. But the role of the United States as a country, as a government, past governments, in the struggle for liberation of South Africa is a shameful role. In general, we were on the side of the apartheid government. And the role of Cuba is a splendid role in favor of the liberation.&#8221;</p>
<p>    Gleijeses gives the relevant history: &#8220;Che Guevara was sent by Fidel Castro as his top representative to sub-Saharan Africa &#8212; it was the first visit by a top Cuban leader to sub-Saharan Africa &#8212; because the Cubans believed that there was a revolutionary situation in central Africa, and they wanted to help. And Che Guevara established relations with a number of revolutionary movements. One of them was the MPLA, the Movement for the Liberation of Angola. &#8230;&#8221; </p>
<p>    &#8220;In 1975, you had the decolonization of Angola, a Portuguese colony slated to become independent on November 11, 1975. There is a civil war between three movements: one supported by the Cubans &#8230; the other two supported by South Africa and the United States. And the movement supported by the Cubans, the MPLA, which is in power in Angola today, having won free elections, was on the verge of winning the civil war.</p>
<p>    &#8220;And in order to prevent their victory &#8230; in October 1975, urged by Washington, South Africa invaded. And the South African troops advanced on [Angolan capital] Luanda, and they would have taken Luanda and crushed the MPLA if Fidel Castro had not decided to intervene. And between November 1975 and April 1976, 36,000 Cuban soldiers poured into Angola and pushed the South Africans back into Namibia, which South Africa ruled at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2013/12/11/nelson_mandela_on_how_cuba_destroyed">In 1991, Nelson Mandela traveled</a> to Cuba to thank Fidel Castro and the Cuban people for supporting the fight against apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa. &#8220;The decisive defeat of the aggressive apartheid forces [in Angola] destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the white oppressor,&#8221; Mandela said. &#8220;The defeat of the apartheid army served as an inspiration to the struggling people of South Africa. &#8230; When we wanted to take up arms, we approached numerous Western governments in search of help and we could only talk with the lowest level officials. When we visited Cuba we were received by the highest authorities who immediately offered anything we wanted and needed. That was our first experience with Cuban internationalism.&#8221;</p>

He is certainly one of the bravest.  The 29-year-old former technical assistant to the CIA and employee of a defense intelligence contractor has admitted to disclosing top secret documents about the National Security Agency’s massive violation of the privacy of law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>Like Daniel Ellsberg, who disclosed the Pentagon Papers, Snowden is a man of principle. “The government has granted itself power it is not entitled to,” he told interviewers.  “There is no public oversight.  The result is that [NSA employees] have the latitude to go further than they are allowed to.” For example, he said, he could have accessed anyone’s e-mail, including the president’s.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the American people have learned that their intelligence agencies are out of control.  I revealed the military’s surveillance of the civil rights and anti-war movements in 1970. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washigton Post disclosed the Watergate burglary by White House operatives, which led Congress to created two select committees to investigate the entire intelligence community. <a href="http://www.accuracy.org/edward-snowden-profile-in-courage/#more-31749" class="more-link">[more]</a></p>

<p>From the start, President Barack Obama has shown little interest or loyalty in the issues that affect the poor, working class and people of color in the United States. For almost his entire first term he didn&#8217;t utter the words poor or poverty. Early on he reminded African Americans: &#8216;I’m not the president of black America. I’m the president of the United States of America…&#8217;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not so surprising that Obama hasn’t done much of substance or impact to ease, let alone end, the depression in the black community. He’s been on the side of the banks and Wall Street since co-signing George Bush’s and Hank Paulsen’s TARP &#8216;too big to fail&#8217; bank bailout at the expense of underwater homeowners and middle-class taxpayers. <a href="http://www.accuracy.org/obamas-economic-race-legacy/#more-31517" class="more-link">[more]</a></p>

<p>But despite the fact that lives (American, allied, and civilian) continue to be lost in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Israel is blustering about attacking Iran before the US election (in order to drag in a reluctant Obama administration), much more time will be given to domestic policy rantings then foreign policy. In the 2000 election, there was very little debate about foreign policy, though anyone who looked closely might have guessed that Bush&#8217;s foreign policy advisors (who called themselves &#8220;the vulcans,&#8221; and had complex and long-standing links to groups and think tanks pressing for war on Iraq, would undertake that project at the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>This year, with less excuse (given the large deficit and two ongoing military operations), we have had very little discussion in the media about Romney&#8217;s foreign policy advisors. Yet, they are a far more coherent group of militarists than the Bush team.</p>

In 2010, the number was more than 15,000 killed. Between December 2006, when Felipe Calderón of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) took office and declared a &#8220;war on drug traffickers&#8221; and January 2012, depending on the source, some 47,000 to 60,000 people have been slain, and some 5,000 disappeared. This grim fact has become the centerpiece of Mexican politics and an inescapable force in daily life throughout much of the country.</p>
<p>But neither the number of people killed nor the cruelty of the killings can be understood without simultaneously taking account of another pair of figures. First, Calderón has repeatedly said that more than 90 percent of those killed were involved in &#8220;the struggle of some cartels against others.&#8221; Calderón does not cite a source for this estimate. The underlying logic, however, is clear: if you&#8217;re dead, you&#8217;re guilty. The perennial official refrain is &#8220;<em>en algo andaba</em>,&#8221; or, they were up to something; they were in the game. <a href="http://www.accuracy.org/dying-to-live-in-mexico/#more-28323" class="more-link">[more]</a></p>

<p>“Towns and cities throughout our entire country are losing their historic post offices and often the New Deal artworks designed for them. The giant real estate company CBRE advises the USPS on what post offices to sell and then profits by representing both the seller and buyer.&#8221; </p>
<p>    “USPS management plans to sell Berkeley’s magnificent 1914 Main Post Office containing a New Deal sculpture and mural. Our grandparents paid for this building and many others in the country that are on the USPS-CBRE hit list. They belong to us as much as do the National Parks. National landmark status and widespread community opposition counts for nothing as USPS management continues to liquidate the public&#8217;s property and its constitutionally guaranteed service while the press sleeps on what Americans are losing and who is profiting from their loss.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Volcker Rule&#8217; represents Glass-Steagall-lite. It cannot work because it avoids doing what Glass-Steagall did &#8212; creating a &#8216;bright line&#8217; rule separating what was permissible from what was forbidden. The failure to simply repeal the repeal of Glass-Steagall and repeal the Commodities Futures Modernization Act (which created the regulatory &#8216;black hole&#8217; for financial derivatives) demonstrates how FDR was willing to act boldly because he learned the correct lessons from the Great Depression whereas both of our parties have acted timidly in response to the Great Recession. The result will be the worst of all worlds. The five largest U.S. banks do virtually all of the financial derivative trading by U.S. banks. They run massive proprietary derivatives trading desks that speculate in hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivatives. The Volcker Rule, in an effort to limit the evasions that are made inevitable by its failure to act boldly and ban derivative derivatives, will reportedly be over 850 pages. It will be a nightmare for bank examiners and honest banks, yet the big cheating banks will easily evade it by calling their speculation &#8216;hedging.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

During the 28 years of his incarceration, Mandela defied his captors from his cell by preserving his humanity and compassion in the face of the brutality unleashed against him, and many other political dissidents, by the U.S.-backed, Apartheid South African regime. Recall that the <a href="http://www.fair.org/blog/2013/12/06/nyt-takes-mandelas-death-as-a-chance-to-mock-his-fight-to-free-his-country/">CIA tipped off the South African government so they were finally able to capture Mandela</a>, who had proven to be so illusive.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mood here in South Africa is terribly somber. This was the day that everyone knew would come. &#8230; I happened to work in his [Mandela's] office twice, &#8217;94 and &#8217;96, and saw these [economic] policies being pushed on Mandela by international finance and domestic business and a neoliberal conservative faction within his own party.&#8221; Bond cites a former Mandela cabinet member, Ronnie Kasrils: &#8220;He basically says that as a ruler Mandela gave in way too much to rich people. So he replaced racial apartheid with class apartheid.&#8221;</p>
