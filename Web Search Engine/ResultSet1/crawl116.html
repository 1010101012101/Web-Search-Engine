"The cyber attack will remain a serious threat to our national security," said Francis Maude, the minister responsible for cyber security.

Among provisions aimed at reversing the across-the-board "sequestration" government spending cuts and reducing federal deficits, lawmakers restricted access to an index the Social Security Administration keeps of people who have died. Better controls over such information will save an estimated $786 million in government payments to people who steal dead people's Social Security numbers and other information to fraudulently claim tax refunds and credits and Medicare payments, a Senate aide said. The accord, which came days ahead of a self-imposed deadline, was an unexpected break from a cycle of fiscal brinkmanship that caused a government shutdown in October and brought the country close to default and blemished its pristine credit rating in 2011.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/death-master-file-reform-breathes-life-u-budget-235756628--sector.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2013 18:57:56 -0500</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">death-master-file-reform-breathes-life-u-budget-235756628--sector</guid></item><item><title>Senate poised for talkathon over Obama nominees</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/senate-poised-talkathon-over-obama-nominees-235642042--politics.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/bEiCkEQnWZu75B0_9TbfWA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/471de69088b08729450f6a70670029c8.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="FILE - In this June 4, 2013 file photo, President Barack Obama gestures while speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, June 4, 2013, to announce the judicial nominations including Patricia Ann Millett, right, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
