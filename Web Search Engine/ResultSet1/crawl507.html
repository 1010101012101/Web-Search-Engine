				<p>We need a new pecking order in America. It’s time to elect a chick
to the White House. But this is not just any chick. This is Mae Poulet, top hen
of Los Angeles,
all-around feathered friend.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef017c32d6f7aa970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Mae pouletfacebook" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c853253ef017c32d6f7aa970b" src="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef017c32d6f7aa970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Mae pouletfacebook" /></a>Satchel, a dog in Tennessee,
who has been running a campaign for president for the past year, has chosen my California chicken, Mae
Poulet, to be his running mate. I got her from Craigslist in 2010. The ad read,
“Free. Would make a good dinner.” Now she roams freely in my half-acre backyard with five
other hens. </p>
<p>Chickens know how to cross the road—or the aisle—to bring
all sides together, and studies show they are far more productive than
politicians. </p>
<p>Mae has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MaePoulet" target="_self" title="Mae Poulet on Facebook">Facebook page</a>, and she is familiar with the public
arena. In 2011, she helped with a Natalie Portman – Jason Alexander nonprofit
campaign to raise money for poultry in need.&#0160;
</p>
<p>There are two primary components to Mae’s political platform.
</p>
<p>The first is protecting animals, an area in which Barack Obama
and Mitt Romney have a poor record. Romney strapped his dog to the top of his
car and chose Paul Ryan, a hunter, for his ticket. Obama was graded a dismal C-
by the Humane Society of the United
  States and broke a campaign promise to adopt
a shelter dog if elected. Instead, he got a pure-bred pup from Ted Kennedy. &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Four million dogs and cats are killed in U.S. shelters each
year at a staggering cost of $600 million. This is not only heart-breaking for
the animals, but a fiscally irresponsible situation. Mae wants people to spay and
neuter their animals and to stop buying from breeders and pet shops. She and
Satchel support policies that protect both animals and people’s pocketbooks. </p>
<p>Secondly, Mae wants third party voices and third party
candidates to be heard. Some studies show that 40% of the people in this nation
identify as independents, yet Democrats and Republicans talk about
“bi-partisan” rather than “non-partisan” solutions. The concerns of independents
are rarely, if ever, addressed. &#0160;</p>
<p>“Not everyone is a donkey or elephant,’ Mae says. “Some of
us are chickens or even people. The two parties have fowled things up
miserably. It’s time for real change.” &#0160;</p>
<p>As for me, I never envisioned my chicken would be running for
vice-president. She seemed so non-political when I adopted her.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="color: #00007f;">You’ve probably heard of filling someone’s shoes, but have
you heard of filling her seat? Award shows tend to be televised, and producers
want a full audience for camera panning purposes. This is especially true for the
first fifteen rows of the theater where celebrities sit. At some point, a famous
attendee may need to perform on stage or accept an award; thus, a substitute is
temporarily hustled into her spot. This substitute or seat filler may be
required to play musical chairs, or she may remain in one place all evening. It
depends on the needs of the producer. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">My mission was to go undercover at a televised show called
“Teachers Rock,” which was to be broadcast from the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. I applied to
be a seat filler with hopes of learning how this highly unusual profession works.
Could this be the key to unemployment? Could filling seats fill bank accounts?
It turned out the answer was no because the salary is zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">I received my congratulatory email. I was one of the 827 people
chosen to receive no pay for volunteering to be near the rich and famous for
four hours. This was almost as good as helping hungry children. I had a warm
and fuzzy feeling knowing I’d be assisting an affluent TV producer and Hollywood’s biggest stars
with their empty seat dilemma. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef017c31705f8d970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="CharlotteLawsredcarpetbaackstagebettersize" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c853253ef017c31705f8d970b" src="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef017c31705f8d970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="CharlotteLawsredcarpetbaackstagebettersize" /></a>Ad revenues for a televised show can top $70 million, and it
can cost $35,000 for one celebrity to get ready for an event, after factoring
in the designer dress and other necessities like Botox and the personal stylist.
Plus production expenses can be exorbitant; the price tag for the 79<sup>th</sup>
Annual Academy Awards was $30 million. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">It would be relatively economical to give each seat filler
fifty bucks, so why the resistance? Could nonpayment be part of a sinister plot
to maintain the gap between the rich and the poor? Probably not. It’s more like
common sense. If you can get people to do something for free, why pay?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">I hoped my altruism would not go unnoticed, as I read the
stringent rules associated with my important new job. The dress code required long
pants and a sweater. This made total sense considering the temperature that day
was 110 degrees. Furthermore, I was excited to learn that I would be standing
in the delightful heat in a long line—something I do regularly as a hobby--for
an hour and a half prior to the show. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">I was told to wear flat shoes, which meant my embarrassing shortness
might end up on national television. Yippee. I was not allowed to dress in red and
had to leave my camera at home because photos were not permitted. Plus, talking
to stars was a big no-no. Of course, everybody knows that famous people only
talk to other famous people. I think it’s a law. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">The end of the email mentioned the repercussions for not
following rules. I could be ousted from the event and prohibited from what I
call future slave labor opportunities. Although I am normally a rebel, I didn’t
want to tangle with the seat filler police and thought the words “fired from indentured
servitude” could hurt my resume. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">As I drove to the event in my woolly mammoth pantsuit, I
thought about the poor souls in their air conditioned homes, missing the
bumper-to-bumper traffic on the 101 freeway. I envisioned my hour and half wait
in the heat and wondered if I could pay a “line stander” to hold my seat filler
slot.&#0160;&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">Upon arrival at the Nokia, I was astonished to learn that my
fellow seat fillers were postmoderns. They’d reinterpreted the instructions,
creating their own personal reality. They’d translated “long pants and a sweater”
to mean “sleeveless, cotton sundress.” They’d decided “flat shoes” meant four-inch
high pumps. They believed crimson, scarlet and burgundy were not really red at
all, and they thought cell phones that took pictures did not qualify as cameras.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">I meandered through the line in my Arctic wear, conducting
interviews. Everyone was upbeat. A college student named Derrion said he was
there because he liked helping the seat filling company. I asked, “Isn’t that
like doing charity work for Exxon Mobil?” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">Shannon, a sales clerk, told me about her close encounter
with Jim Carrey at the Teen Choice Awards. The actor tried to get her to talk,
but she snubbed him because she didn’t want to get in trouble with her seat
filling supervisor. Carrey even offered her the rest of the water in his
plastic bottle, but she ignored him. She told me, “Now I regret it. I think I
made him feel bad. Plus, I could have sold the empty container on Ebay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">Felicia, an actress, broke the “no conversation” rule with Paris
Hilton, who handed her a glass of champagne at the 2009 MTV Music Awards. They
sipped together in ringside seats. “So you were drinking on the job?” I asked. &#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">Then Felicia and Hilton exchanged details about their horoscopes;
they are a Libra and Aquarius, respectively. Hilton said to Felicia, “We’re birds.
We like to fly because we are air signs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">Felicia told me it’s hard to fly in the acting business these
days because the pay has decreased. “Everyone wants to be an actor, so producers
pay less. I used to get $500 to do a music video in a bikini. Today, I’m lucky
to be offered fifty bucks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">Jason, a burly construction worker, once sat between Cheech
and Chong at a show. I asked him what that was like, and he said, “Well, I
didn’t smell marijuana, if that’s what you mean.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">Others in line had rubbed shoulders with Katy Perry, Britney
Spears, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Luke Bryan, LeAnn Rimes, Carrie Underwood,
Ashton Kutcher, Jermaine Jackson and Gwen Stefani. All loved being seat fillers
and didn’t mind the lack of pay, although they admitted it was really uncompensated
extra work. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">The seat filling company has no shortage of volunteers. The
owner maintains a database of 33,000 applicants, and some folks travel from Belgium, South
 Africa and New Zealand just to taste the lifestyle
of the rich and famous. &#0160;&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">It was almost show time. The postmoderns and I were led into
the auditorium and told to fill empty seats. Unlike the Grammy’s or Oscar’s, the
“Teachers Rock” event was low profile. I figured it wouldn’t lead to celebrity
encounters, free flowing champagne or anything unusual. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">So, you can imagine my surprise when I met a space alien.
“I’m a retired private investigator,” a senior citizen next to me said. “And
this is my wife. She’s a Grobanite.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">I’d never heard of the planet, Groban. In fact, I’d never seen
a spaceship or been abducted from a field in Nebraska. I tentatively shook the woman’s hand,
hoping she would not examine my reproductive organs. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">“What galaxy is that in?” I asked. She laughed and explained
that she was a fan of the entertainer Josh Groban, who would be performing that
night.&#0160; I was relieved because frankly I
wasn’t in the mood to leave Earth, especially in my woolly mammoth pantsuit. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00007f;">The show ended after live performances from Groban, Garth Brooks,
Dierks Bentley and the group, “fun.” I moved out of my row with other seat
fillers, when a supervisor said, “Don’t even <em>try</em> to go backstage.” With that, I donned my own postmodern lens
and went backstage, where I schmoozed with Chef Curtis Stone and the king of
his own planet, Mr. Josh. In my defense, I didn’t <em>try</em> to do anything. It just happened.</span> </p>

<div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Cyber rape is a disturbing trend in which websites upload copyright-protected naked images in order to trash reputations and end careers; and of course, make money. I spent a heart-wrenching week consoling victims. Some whimpered into the phone and begged for help. All had small and terrified voices, but psychological trauma is common after rape. Although the perpetrator had never touched their flesh, he had inflicted violence in much the same way as a traditional offender might.&#0160;</span></div>
<div>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The cyber rapist is Hunter Moore of the website, IsAnyoneUp.com. Some of his most ardent supporters proudly label him this way. Moore posts naked photos of ordinary people, which he links to their Facebook or Twitter accounts, often indicating their hometown and place of work. Beneath the pictures, Moore’s followers post crude and misogynistic remarks. Victims might be taunted as “fat cows,” “creatures with nasty teeth,” “ugly whores,” “white trash sluts” and “whales.” One commenter says, ”Jesus, someone call Greenpeace and get her back in the water.” Moore has posted pictures of a partially blind paraplegic, a kindergarten teacher, and a mentally incapacitated woman, among others. The website is not about pornography; it is about hurting others.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Moore brags that he is a “professional life ruiner” and “scummy” and that his website is “pure evil”; and he maintains that his victims—both male and female—asked to be abused. In his view, those who snap sexy pictures in the privacy of their bedroom are sluts and deserve to lose their jobs, embarrass their families and find themselves forever ruined. When a person’s name and naked body gets indexed into Google and other search engines, it is almost impossible to remove. Like an infectious disease; it spreads quickly and can prove fatal to reputation, especially when foreign websites snag the images and further disseminate them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Moore chooses his victims carefully. He does not post well-to-do, A-list celebrities—although he claims to possess such photos--because he fears they could nail him with a pricey lawsuit. He preys on the vulnerable: those who lack resources or “connections.” Copyright lawyer Marc Randozza says that bringing a lawsuit to fruition against Moore could cost $60,000. Although a judge can award a victim as much as $150,000 per copyright infringement and although Moore would most probably lose in court, Randozza thinks Moore might hide his assets. This would leave plaintiffs with nothing and feeling further exploited.&#0160;&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Mainstream media is often wrong about Moore because he has a whimsical relationship with the truth. Moore does not live in San Francisco, nor does his lawyer live in Las Vegas, as he claims. Moore rarely removes photos when asked, begged or served with legal letters. He ignores copyright infringement; and his website is <em>not</em> largely a platform for “revenge porn,” as most articles say. “Revenge porn” occurs when an angry ex submits nude photos of a former boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife in order to trash the other person’s reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I embarked upon an investigation of Moore and his website in January 2012. I randomly chose 25 individuals who had been uploaded onto the site within a 14-day period. Most of these folks were difficult to find. Victims of cyber rape tend to blame themselves, crawl into an emotional fetal position and shut down their above-board online presence. They may close their Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn pages, not realizing that these accounts serve as a partial buffer against the disturbing data from Moore’s site. When all positive information about them vanishes, only the negative remains. It becomes easier for their employer or grandmother to do a Google search and to find the nude photos and offensive comments.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">My findings were astonishing: a full 40% of the victims I located had been hacked only days before their photos were loaded onto the site. In most cases, the scam began through Facebook and ended when the thief gained access to the victim’s email account. The hacker did not nab credit card information. He or she seemed to have only one goal: to steal images for “Is Anyone Up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">One victim had never shown her photos to anyone, nor did she intend to. She had taken the shots in the mirror alone with her cell phone and sent them to her email account in order to store them on her computer. Another victim had emailed her topless photo only to her husband; another had sent her shot only to her doctor. All victims promptly asked Moore to remove the illegal material from his website; he would not. Although the victims owned the copyright (in that they had taken the shots of themselves), they registered the pictures with the US Copyright office in Washington, DC, and their lawyers sent “cease and desist letters” (DMCA takedown requests) to Moore; he ignored these as well.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In addition to the “hacked” victims, I found three people (a full 12% of my sample group) who claim their names and faces are posted next to nude bodies that are not actually theirs. “If my ex-husband finds out, I will lose custody of my children,” a middle-aged woman wept into the phone. “I have sent 20 letters to Hunter Moore. It’s not me. He won’t take the photos down; and I don’t know what to do.” Toronto Maple Leaf hockey player Mike Zigomanis (who was not part of my investigation) also claims that the faceless penis pictures next to his name on the website are of someone else. The scandal is negatively affecting his career; a Google search with Zigomanis’ name plus the word “nude” garners 30,000 results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Through my investigation, I found nine victims of revenge porn (36% of my test group) and three “self-submits” (12%). “Self-submits,” of course, are not victims at all; they are individuals who willingly sent their images to Moore. In the end, it was disturbing to learn that over half of the folks from my sample group were either criminally hacked or posted next to body parts that were not theirs. In addition, copyright infringement on the site was pervasive. Besides the nude shots, it was clear that many fully clothed photos were owned by professional photographers and media outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Moore is not the only cyber rapist in town. IsAnybodyDown.com and WalktheShame.com have popped up in recent weeks, no doubt with hopes of elbowing in on some of Moore’s profits. With an increase in “life ruining” sites, there will no doubt be an increase in victims.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Although I thought the recently-shelved Stop Internet Piracy Act (SOPA) was problematic; I urge Congress to draft an amendment, which I call “SOPA: SEX.” This legislation would pertain only to images and videos depicting nudity or sex; and it would require websites to immediately remove questionable material (when alerted about copyright infringement) until a court rules on the issue.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> “SOPA-SEX” legislation would shift the burden onto website operators, and away from cyber rape victims, who today must embark upon a costly race against the fast-paced web in an effort to preserve their reputation. With passage of “SOPA-SEX,” naked and copyrighted images would not multiply in the cyber sphere for weeks (or months) while lawyers attempt to haul Hunter Moore and his ilk into court. “SOPA-SEX” would be supported by Silicon Valley and Hollywood, by Republicans and Democrats, and most of all, by regular Americans. It is an area in which everyone—except predators—can agree. </span>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Let’s end the shame game. Let’s stop cyber rape. And let’s make Hunter Moore find a new career.&#0160;</span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The “oldest living profession” was the backdrop for the <em>oddest</em> existing beauty pageant.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef016303b3a92a970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Hooker pageantweb" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c853253ef016303b3a92a970d" src="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef016303b3a92a970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Hooker pageantweb" /></a>Nine gals were vying for the nation’s most coveted award: Miss Hooker 2012. The competition was held at the Dragonfly Bar in Hollywood, California. Questions darted through my head. Where was the tenth shady lady listed on the event flyer? Was she strolling down the runway at the county jail? Was Donald Trump her “one phone call”?</p>
<p>Was this a battle of beauty, brains and bedroom skills; or something altogether different? And if turning tricks was a pageant prerequisite, what about an arrest record? Would this mean bonus points or disqualification? Might someone win Miss Congeniality; or were all gals deemed “congenial” by thriving in this “people person” profession in the first place?</p>
<p>After arriving at the contest, I learned my preconceived notions were premature: none of the girls were hookers. In fact, during backstage interviews with several contestants, I learned they had never even <em>met</em> a call girl.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m more qualified to be Miss Hooker than you,” I told Miss Anthropy, a tall brunette immersed in silver sequins. “At least, I’ve <em>known</em> prostitutes.”</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef016764a85274970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Hookercrownweb" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c853253ef016764a85274970b" src="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef016764a85274970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Hookercrownweb" /></a>Another competitor told me she had a serious crush on Johnny Depp, thus if given the opportunity, would charge him zero for her services. I informed her she clearly lacked the business acumen to work in this specialized field.</p>
<p>The talent competition was another area of consternation. One girl ate a hot dog. Another read a book on stage and still another twirled the hula hoop--clearly not the skills I expected from Heidi Fleiss wannabes. &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef0168e9a96dc3970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Hooker pageant 013web" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c853253ef0168e9a96dc3970c" src="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef0168e9a96dc3970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Hooker pageant 013web" /></a>Yet, when contestant Miss Kitty Cadillac worked the stripper pole and set her breasts on fire, the show climaxed. The crowd roared; and the judges were mesmerized. Then Kitty purred through her interview question with a raunchiness that made her the ideal candidate for the crown. She was asked at what point a girl becomes a woman, and replied that it required mastering a particular sexual position (details which I cannot disclose without alarming the moral majority). Kitty’s erotic answer sealed the deal. She had come from humble beginnings in her lifelong quest (or rather her two-month quest) to be Miss Hooker 2012; and she had prevailed.</p>
<p>However, the competition was more than frivolity, gigolo jokes and roasted mammary glands. It was an opportunity to explore the deeper questions of life, such as “Where the heck is contestant number ten and can she meet bail?” I was told she’d never shown for rehearsals, thus proving two things: she had not taken prostitution training seriously, and she’d opted not to “show up” in life.</p>
<p>“Showing up” is a field of study unto itself. I’ve been informally examining it for the past eight years--since being elected into local political office and working as a Los   Angeles city commissioner. Although women comprise 51 percent of the population, they are glaringly absent from political, legal and community events. Women fought tirelessly for the vote during the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and they yearn for equality; but today they earn 77 cents on the male dollar. They claim to want leadership roles in society; but comprise only 16.4 percent of U.S. Congress and only 22.1 percent of executive positions—a number that has decreased in the past decade, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef016764a8540e970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Pageantcutweb" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c853253ef016764a8540e970b" src="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef016764a8540e970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Pageantcutweb" /></a>Politics is where the power is, so if women desire that power, why does testosterone consume the room when it is time to affect change? Why are political events crammed with dudes? Do most ladies lack interest in these matters? Are they secretly content with letting men lead? Or are they intimidated by a society-wide “males only” mentality?</p>
<p>Miss Demeanor, who had hula hooped her way to a loss in the Hooker pageant, told me that women don’t “show up” because the world is a boys’ club. Women are quietly edged out of the arena. “My mom said I could be whatever I wanted, but not every girl gets this sort of encouragement.”</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Miss Demeanor is right, the first step towards true equality is realizing where the power is and “showing up” to grab it. Females must burst into the public sphere, frequenting political meetings, community events and legal forums. They must run for political office; and elect each other. They must assert their opinions, rather than let males dominate the conversation. They must stop muffling their voice. &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was glad I “showed up” to meet the beautiful and empowered women who participated in this admittedly bizarre pageant; they were independent, stylish and strong. I congratulated the winner Miss Kitty Cadillac, who flaunted her leg tattoo, leopard print leotard and rhinestone wand from the edge of the stage. She gave me reassurance that she was the right gal for the job, confiding that she had once met a call girl and had no interest in Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>“Good for you,” I smiled. “You’re as qualified as I am to wear that crown.”<br />____</p>
<p>The constest was sponsored by the Corey Helford Gallery.</p>

				<p>Is there a connection between happiness and History--the tedious, sleep-inducing subject that I was forced to study year after year in school? I was generally a good student, but I remember the “D” on my fourth grade report card as if it was a pimple on my chin. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef0163035875cb970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Colin Quinn and Charlotte Laws in Palm Desert" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c853253ef0163035875cb970d" src="http://charlottelaws.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c853253ef0163035875cb970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Colin Quinn and Charlotte Laws in Palm Desert" /></a>My dislike of History did not wane when I began college at California State University, Northridge. Why memorize dates, battles and the names of dead white guys, who had no relevance to my life? In retaliation, I invented jokes <em>about</em> these dead white guys with my accomplice in crime: classmate Bill Berle (comedian Milton Berle’s son). Like inmates in adjacent cells, we made the best of our stay in the slammer--Western Civilization class--by whispering, by passing notes and by generally disrespecting the material--always careful not to draw unfavorable attention from our warden, the professor. The subject matter was highly conducive to ridicule because it included details about the sex lives of Greeks and other ancient peoples. Let’s just say Rick Santorum would not have condoned their behavior.&#0160;</p>
<p>This brings me to Colin Quinn, the magically funny and devastatingly handsome (but since I am married, I naturally did not notice) comedian. He was performing his brilliant one-man show “Long Story Short” to a sold-out crowd in Palm Desert, California. From my seat behind bird lady (some annoying woman with a peacock feather hat), I watched Colin explore the messed up cultures of the past and masterfully connect them with the messed up cultures of today. He joked that “Ancient Greek kids were just like us. They watched 40 hours of theater per week.” He said that democracy had disintegrated into “Lil Wayne and <em>Girls Gone Wild</em>” and that the Holy Roman Empire was mostly about priests and lots of jewelry.</p>
<p>In addition to nonstop laughs on historical topics, the show offered profound insights. I was particularly intrigued by Colin’s observation that (the pursuit of) “happiness” is part of Declaration of Independence, yet “no other country has made it their <em>policy</em> to cheer people up.” How ironic, I thought. The one country that aims to link history with happiness is largely comprised of folks who believe studying the past is dreary and a waste of time.</p>
<p>Apathy naturally leads to ignorance. According to a Newsweek poll, 29 percent of U.S. citizens cannot name the vice-president and 73 percent are hazy about the reasons for the cold war. In a separate study by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, test takers knew more about <em>American Idol</em> than the Gettysburg Address, and only half could list the three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. In the end, 71 percent of study participants were graded “F”—a pretty big pimple, if you ask me.</p>
<p>According to even more studies, Europeans outperform Americans on “historical facts about the world”; and there are traditional explanations for this: our broken educational system, the ever-widening income gap in the U.S., the abundance of dull and somniferous textbooks, the more intellectually oriented European culture and the fact that America is a large land, separated from most other nations by a whole lot of water. There is an “out of sight, out of mind” mentality--it is difficult to care about stuff so far away.</p>
<p>But I have a final theory, which I call “cut your losses and run.” &#0160;Since Americans start the race 200 paces behind Europeans, why try in the first place? As a nation, we feel disadvantaged historically speaking, so why further embarrass ourselves? We are arguably reluctant to expend effort. We are a new country; we lack the rich traditions and delightful 500-year-old structures. We are better at state-of-the-art and innovation. We fizzle when reminiscing over gray-haired institutions, outmoded customs and long dead ancestors. Why play a game we cannot win?</p>
<p>As a competitive and success-oriented people, we’d rather focus on our strengths: being specialized and making money. History is sort of like Latin. It leads to unemployment. History is for old codgers wearing ascots and lapel pins. America is about youth, energy and advancement. It is about bulldozing the old and making way for the modern. Many of us shoved History into the coat closet years ago; and when confronted by polls (or Jay Leno in a “jaywalking” gag), our apathy becomes evident. We pull dusty, moth-eaten ideas from that closet; and mostly end up with wrong answers and blank stares.</p>
<p>Colin made me realize that although I cannot say happiness <em>is</em> History, learning about the past can add texture to my life. To make a long story short, I now realize I am a “17<sup>th</sup> Century Holland” gal, just as someone else might be an Iron Age enthusiast or a Shang Dynasty devotee. History can transport me beyond today--it can be a form of spirituality. While life is casually reading a book, studying the footnotes can add a dimension or richness that I might not otherwise know.</p>
<p>After the show, I went backstage to schmooze with Colin and to tell him that he’d succeeded in <em>his policy</em> to cheer people up. Pursuing happiness is easier when he is in the room.</p>
<p>Plus, he’s devastatingly handsome (but, of course, I did not notice). &#0160;</p>
