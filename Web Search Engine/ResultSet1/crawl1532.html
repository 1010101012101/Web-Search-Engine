A journalism teacher recently raised a question 
on a listserv. He said he had some colleagues who 
thought it was acceptable to use composite 
characters and dress up the setting in a story.<p>
How depressing. <p>
After all the scandals in recent years involving 
reporters, memoirists and historians who have 
been caught lying, it is disheartening to hear 
that some teachers think it is all right to 
deceive readers. Take note, please. These rules 
will save your honor, your self-respect and maybe 
your career: <p>
<li>Make up nothing. <p>
<li>Embellish nothing. <p>
The minute you make anything up or embellish 
setting or anything else, you?re writing fiction. 
<p>
<li>Do not use composite characters. They are 
fiction. When they are used without disclosure to 
the reader, they are lies. With disclosure, they 
are a cheap gimmick. And they still put your 
entire story in doubt. If the reader knows you?re 
willing to make up a character, he can?t help but 
wonder what else you may have made up. <p>
<li>Don?t change quotes. You can take out the 
meaningless noise?the ums, ahs and ers?and you 
can render words in regular English instead of 
dialect??gonna? is ?going to??but don?t change 
the words. I like the <a 
href="http://blogs.baltimoresun.com/about_language
/" target="_blank">guideline</a>  John McIntyre 
spelled out on his blog recently: ?We don?t want 
the words the speaker uses in print to be 
different from the speaker?s words as broadcast 
on the television or radio.? <p>

<li>Don?t use other people?s writing without 
giving them credit. Be generous with credit. 
Taking other writers? words without acknowledging 
the authors is plagiarism. In more blunt terms, a 
plagiarist is a liar and a thief. <p>
<li>Stay out of people?s heads. You cannot know 
what anyone thinks. Don?t pretend you can. <p>
<li>Don?t lie by omission. If you distort the 
story by leaving out information essential to 
understanding, it is just as wrong as making up 
details. <p>
<li>Don?t ignore that uneasy feeling in the back 
of your mind. Pay attention to it. <p>
The rules hold in all forms of nonfiction, 
including narrative. Some writers think that 
narrative gives them license to play loose with 
the facts. It doesn?t. Narrative requires 
reporting that is every bit as rigorous as 
straight 
news writing and requires the same unyielding 
standards of 
accuracy.</div><BR>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">
			<div style="overflow: auto">In his book <i>On Writing</i>, 
Stephen King 
says:<p>
?If you want to be a writer, you must do two 
things above all others: read a lot and write a 
lot. There?s no way around these two things that 
I?m aware of, no shortcuts. <p>
?I?m a slow reader, but I usually get through 
seventy or eighty books a year, mostly fiction.? 
<p>
Slow reader? Maybe, but his yearly total is 
pretty respectable. <p>
Mr. King?s advice is dead on, but it is probably 
wasted on people who don?t already have the 
reading habit. These are people who tell you they 
love to read, but they just don?t have time. They 
are going to read more when they get the time. 
No, they?re not. They might as well quit kidding 
themselves.<p>
Some of them might develop the reading habit if 
they thought of reading as a pleasure, which it 
is, and not as a duty. <p>
Read what you enjoy, or read because you want to 
learn something that interests you. Don?t worry 
about reading what you think you should read, or 
what other people think you should read. <p>
Don?t feel guilty if you don?t enjoy books that 
are supposed to be good for you. If you have to 
force yourself to read, you won?t stick with it 
long and you won?t get much out of it. <p>
But sample all sorts of writing. Before 
dismissing a book as boring, give it a chance. 
Read a page or two or three. Good writing has a 
way of drawing you in even when the subject never 
interested you before. <p>
If you read for pleasure, read a lot, you will 
soak up writing lessons without trying. After a 
while, though, you will find yourself noticing 
the lessons?beginning to see how the writer 
achieves the effects that make the story work. 
This won?t lessen your pleasure; it will increase 
it. <p>
Many books have more to give than you can get 
from one reading. The classic example is Mark 
Twain?s <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. An adolescent 
can read it as an adventure story. The same 
reader can revisit the book with a more mature 
understanding and discover that it is not only a 
great adventure story, but also is a commentary 
on slavery and human nature. <p>
A lesser-known example is <i>The Ballad of the 
Flim-Flam Man</i> by Guy Owen. It?s a novel about 
a down-at-the-heels grifter and a young rube who 
ramble across North Carolina working one small-
time swindle after another. You can read it as a 
rollicking comedy, which it is. But if you read 
it again, the novel will take you deeper and 
deeper until the laughter becomes mixed with 
sorrow and sympathy for the frailties of human 
beings. (You know, don?t you, that sorrow and 
pain are the wellsprings of much of our humor?) 
<p>
One class of books is especially worth reading 
again and again: guidebooks for writers. A writer 
can read these for pleasure as well as for the 
learning. If a book on writing well isn?t 
pleasurable reading, it isn?t likely that the 
author has much to teach you. <p>
You can return to a book such as <i>The Careful 
Writer</i> by Theodore Bernstein or <i>On Writing 
Well</i> by William Zinsser and gain something 
new every time. Here are some other writing books 
that reward you every time you go back to them: 
<i>Stein on Writing</i>, by Sol Stein; <i>The 
Book on Writing</i>, by Paula LaRocque; <i>The 
Word</i>, by Rene J. Cappon; <i>The Writer?s 
Art</i>, by James J. Kilpatrick. <p>
Some writers may scorn the recommendation to read 
books on the craft. In <i>The Language of the 
Night</i>, Ursula K. LeGuin says she doesn?t read 
such books. I wouldn?t presume to argue the point 
with her. Her success?she is one of our most 
honored writers of science fiction and fantasy?
speaks for itself. <p>
Most of us, though, including me, aren?t as smart 
as she is. Books on the craft won?t infuse 
creativity or make you an original thinker. They 
can, however, help you learn the tools and 
techniques you need and save you much effort. It 
seems to me that so many writers struggle to 
discover principles that were discovered long ago?
as far back as Aristotle. Some of that struggle 
is unnecessary.

	</tr>

			<div style="overflow: auto">

A friend sent the first draft of a story and it 
wasn?t good. My friend tends to beat herself up 
when the writing doesn?t come easily, but she 
shouldn?t. It is OK when a first draft fails to 
be brilliant?provided the writer understands that 
the draft is just the beginning of the work. <p>
The writer fails only if he or she tries to foist 
the draft on readers?or dumps it on an editor to 
salvage. <p>
Some writers in journalism pay lip service to the 
idea of revising, but the truth is they don?t 
want to do it. As soon as they get a story in 
written form, however rough, they want to move on 
to the next one. <p>
The nature of journalism tends to encourage 
impatience and short attention spans?or at least 
gives these writers an excuse for their attitude. 
Some stories must be written on deadline, with no 
time to rewrite. Because rewriting is sometimes 
not feasible, the writers find it easy to avoid 
even when it is feasible. The writers get in the 
habit of regarding rewriting as an artsy-craftsy 
indulgence. They get unspoken reinforcement from 
editors who accept rough drafts and publish them 
as is or who do the revision the writers should 
be required to do.<p>
The truth is, though, that often the reporter has 
time, or can arrange to have time, for rewriting. 
Many news and feature stories need not be written 
on deadline. <p>
The better writers learn to embrace the 
opportunity to do new drafts, and some enjoy it. 
They learn to throw out words, phrases, 
paragraphs that don?t serve the story. <p>
Revising allows them to: <p>
<li>Reshape the story. First drafts often lack 
focus and flow. In subsequent drafts, the writer 
imposes order?or lets the story find its natural 
order. <p>
<li>Trim flab. This can include even elements?
anecdotes, bits of description, clever metaphors?
that might be fine in themselves but don?t 
advance the story.<p>
<li>Nail the theme. At the heart of a good story 
is an idea, even though it may not be expressed 
directly. Sometimes the idea gets lost in the 
first draft.<p>
<li>Hide the seams: Part of what makes rough 
drafts rough is the clumsy way the parts are 
stitched together. Characters are introduced 
awkwardly. Quotes are plopped in without enough 
context for the reader to understand. <p>
First drafts might come out better more often if 
writers would take the trouble to plan them. Many 
journalists don?t. This is another idea they pay 
lip service to but fail to practice. <p>
Instead of organizing the story, they concentrate 
on writing a clever lead, or what they imagine to 
be a clever lead. They hope the rest of the story 
will flow from their lead. If the story is the 
least bit complicated, this is a route to 
disaster. <p>
Again, it is all right if the first draft is 
disastrous, so long as you revise it. But at some 
point, you need to map out the story, so why not 
do it before the first draft and get ahead of the 
game? You may still need to revise that draft, 
but the revision will probably be considerably 
easier. <p>
I mentioned my friend who was having trouble with 
a story. A couple of days later, she sent another 
draft and it was much better. I knew it would be. 
My friend is a pro.</div><BR>

			<div style="overflow: auto">
Roy Peter Clark of the Poynter Institute is 
crafting a ?starter kit? on <a 
href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.
asp?id=118571" target="_blank">writing serial 
</a> narratives in newspapers. <p>
Check it out. Even if you are not a journalist, 
you can learn from Mr. Clark?s teachings. In 
fact, you should make it a point to read his 
Writing Tools blog and all of his articles on 
storytelling. Read his own serial narratives.<p>
As I?ve said before, narratives?whether done as 
serials or single stories?are wonderful magnets 
for readers. I wish more newspaper editors 
encouraged their writers to use narrative tools 
and taught them how to do it. <p>
But as I have also said before, narratives done 
badly are terrible. Some journalists hear that 
word ?narrative? and they suddenly start writing 
purple prose, dripping with adjectives and 
adverbs. They seem to think narrative is a 
license to write tedious description, to 
substitute literary-sounding clichés for solid 
details and to plod into stories with leisurely 
leads that bore readers. The results can be 
embarrassing. <p>
Writing a narrative is different from writing 
conventional news and feature stories. It 
requires a different approach and different 
techniques, and these must be learned. They must 
be practiced, too. <p>
Practice with small narratives. A narrative need 
not be a blockbuster or a serial with multiple 
chapters. Good narratives can be done in 12 to 20 
inches. They can even be done on deadline.<p>
Practice using narrative techniques even in 
stories that are not narratives. A section of 
dialogue, for example, might add zing to that 
meeting story you have to write. <p>
When you can write a taut short narrative, when 
you are comfortable with the tools of narrative?
description, dialogue, suspense, scenes, 
cliffhangers?then you can try more ambitious 
projects such as a serial.</div><BR>

		<td valign="top">
			<div style="overflow: auto"><p>Voice and style matter, 
but inexperienced 
writers do best to approach them indirectly, with 
their attention on other issues.</p>
<p> If they think about their style and voice as 
they write, they may exaggerate or distort both. 
Concentrate, instead, on matters such as 
accuracy, clarity and simplicity. Concentrate on 
the goal of making the work easy and pleasurable 
for the reader. If writers do that, style and 
voice will take care of themselves. </p>
<p> This advice isn?t needed by writers who have 
mastered their craft. Such writers have the 
discipline to make conscious decisions about 
voice and carry them off. </p>
<p> In any case, there?s nothing sacred about 
voice and style. Never use them to defend bad 
writing. Some writers do that because their egos 
won?t let them admit the writing is bad or 
because they are insecure. </p>
<p> They turn in copy that is turgid and stuffy 
or, at the other extreme, sophomorically breezy. 
Then they get all prickly if an editor dares to 
tamper with it. </p>
<p> As a coach, I would rather work with almost 
any other writer than one who prattles about 
voice and style and can?t face the least 
criticism. </p>
<p> Any writer has a voice. The question is 
whether the voice is appealing. People won?t sit 
in an audience listening to a speaker whose voice 
is unpleasant, and readers won?t stay with a 
writer whose work is boring or distracting. </p>
<p> If the writing isn?t working, it needs to be 
fixed. The way to fix it is to focus not on voice 
or style but on the specific problems that mar 
the work. </p>
<p> Is the copy deadened by cliches and deadwood? 
Get rid of them. Are there strained similes and 
labored metaphors? Cut them. Is the tone pompous 
because the writer is being pretentious and 
trying to show off his vocabulary? Rewrite, using 
plain words and speaking conversationally to the 
reader. </p>
<p> Fix the problems, whatever they are, and you 
will find that style and voice are much improved.
