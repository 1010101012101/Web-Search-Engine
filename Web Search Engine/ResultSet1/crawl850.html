					  A former Chicago Police officer who has emerged as one of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s most trusted advisers was chosen Tuesday to lead Chicago’s scandal-plagued Department of Buildings. Felicia Davis replaces attorney Michael Merchant, who was promoted to the job of Chicago Housing Authority CEO after Charles Woodyard was forced out.

					  Chicago would become the nation’s fourth major city to establish an independent budget office to advise the City Council — and the first city to do so without a voter referendum — under a $485,000 plan advanced Tuesday that satisifed no one.  On one side is Ald. Anthony Beale (9th), who wants to bankroll the new office on an hourly, “pay-as-you-go” basis instead of asking all 50 aldermen to forfeit $3,000 from their annual allowance for office expenses and contractual employees.

					  Relying on only one appraisal paid for by the Cubs, a City Council committee agreed Tuesday to vacate up to 25 feet of street and sidewalk on Waveland and Sheffield to pave the way for the renovation of 99-year-old Wrigley Field. Marous & Co. valued the land at $3.75 million and the air-rights above it at $250,000. The city did not order its own appraisal.
