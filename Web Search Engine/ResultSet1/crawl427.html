Big surprise for me...</a></b></div>Well, I think I've held out longer than most...&nbsp; seven years in Internet time is pretty long! Since April 2002, this blog has been hosted on the "radio.weblogs.com" server run by Userland Software, the company that makes the blogging package&nbsp; "<a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a>." The hosting has been included in the modest ($40) annual licensing fee for the software since 2002. Today I stumbled on the news that practice will end in December. <br><br>Too bad. I never did get around to memorizing the number in the address. I think 0106327, means that I was user number 6,327. Or maybe it was number 327? I seriously doubt that there were ever 106,327 of us, but maybe I underestimated the operation.<br><br>I had switched to Radio Userland from two no-charge-for-hosting blogs, because Radio gave me an automatic backup copy of the blog on my own computer, as well as the security that comes with knowing you're paying for something instead of trusting some dotcom startup's&nbsp; free-service business model. The other two blogs were done with Userland's other program, Manila, and with a system called Trellix -- and both of those blog servers have long since gone away. ("Free" services can be like that. But I hope no one at Google/Blogger is listening.) <br><br>Here's my first Radio post: <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106327/2002/04/07.html"><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106327/2002/04/07.html">http://radio.weblogs.com/0106327/2002/04/07.html</a></a> <br><br>Heh... I see that back then I still treated "Web log" as two words some of the time, even referred to "logs" instead of "blogs." How quaint. That was even though I'd been <a href="http://boblog.blogspot.com/2001/12/my-short-essay-on-weblogs.html">playing with blogger.com</a> <a href="http://boblog.blogspot.com/2001/12/my-short-essay-on-weblogs.html?showComment=1245787165001#c2311942168602131260">since the previous December</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Blogging History</span><br>Radio Userland at that point was used by some of the top bloggers, including (of course) <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a>, who founded Userland. Others included a self-promoting former MTV dude named Adam Curry, as well as Robert Scoble (who worked for Userland before going to Microsoft), and Linux Journal's Cluetrain guru Doc Searls, and more. Unlike every other "blogging platform" I'd tried, Radio put the software on your local computer -- laptop or desktop -- not just out on a Web server someplace. Along with the security of having my own local copy, I liked to work on blog items offline on a laptop in those pre-wifi days. I'd do some writing at a coffeeshop, then connect the modem at home or plug in an office Ethernet and "publish" the blog contents to the server.<br><br>As an alternative to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com"><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com">http://radio.weblogs.com</a></a>, Userland also offered the option of using your own server, but I never bothered to make the switch, taking an "if it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it" approach even after I set up <a href="http://stepno.com"><a href="http://stepno.com">http://stepno.com</a></a> as my static home page. Now I guess I'll figure out how to move the blog over there, at least for archival purposes. I might even use this transition as an excuse to install my own WordPress server,&nbsp; a good educational experience for me. We are using WordPress more and more here at Radford University, but I've never started from scratch. I've used three or four "hosted" WordPress accounts, including <a href="http://stepno.wordpress.com"><a href="http://stepno.wordpress.com">http://stepno.wordpress.com</a></a> and <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/stepno"><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/stepno">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/stepno</a></a> -- an experiment and a cobweb, respectively. Always time to learn new things... (For the past year I've been learning about Drupal to do <a href="http://www.radford.edu/comm"><a href="http://www.radford.edu/comm">http://www.radford.edu/comm</a></a> )<br><br>In fact, the last time I flirted with the idea of hosting a blog server, it was a year or two before Radio Userland came along: I had licensed a copy of its parent system, Userland Frontier and Userland Manila, intending to host a site at Emerson College's Department of Journalism. But the&nbsp; technology folks across campus wouldn't let me run a server from our building, blaming the antiquated wiring. My office was once the servants' quarters on the fourth floor of a 90-year-old Beacon Street brownstone. When I moved out, Emerson sold the building. Today that floor is a $4 million condo. I suspect the wiring has been upgraded. As for the server, I had (more than) enough to handle with new courses to teach and a dissertation to finish, so I never pressed the issue. <br><br>It dawns on me that if Emerson had given me a chance to build that site, we would have beaten Harvard to the punch by a few years. Userland Manila and blogging came to Harvard when the Law School's Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society gave Dave Winer a fellowship in 2003, and he set up the original <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu"><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu</a></a> using Userland Manila. (A while after he left, the school migrated it to WordPress.) <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Radio Userland and Dawn of Podcasting</span><br>Geeky digression: The name <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio</a> is full of irony. Perhaps Userland called the program that because blogs are, in a way, a form of broadcasting -- but I don't think Userland actually had "audio programs" in mind, even though it turned out that Radio included the essential tools of what became "<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106327/stories/2005/02/09/podcastingVideoBlogging.html">podcasting</a>," the idea of sending radio-like programs over the Internet. Winer had built in to Userland Radio an&nbsp; <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106327/stories/2006/02/03/whatsRss.html">RSS feed</a>  generator and an RSS <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/resource/printable/article/0,aid,116018,00.asp">aggregator</a> (receiver)... and he had tweaked the RSS standard to allow "enclosed" media files. <br><br>At Harvard Winer started using that kind of "enclosure" feed with fellow Harvard blogger and NPR-veteran <a href="http://radioopensource.org">Christopher Lydon</a>'s recorded interviews. A few weeks later, Userland customer Adam Curry, across the Atlantic, hacked together an Applescript to lift Lydon's interviews out of his Radio folder and dump them into an iTunes folder for transfer to his iPod. A few weeks later, a journalist at The Guardian used the word "podcast" for the first time, describing the Lydon interviews.<br><br>(I set up a separate podcasting blog to give it a try myself, got it workign for a demo, but then let my "<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106327/categories/podfolk">Podfolk</a>" site become an intermittent music blog instead.)<br><br>Anyhow, I'm searching my mailbox for official word that the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com"><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com">http://radio.weblogs.com</a></a> service is closing.

F. Stone's contacts with the Soviet Union... back when there was one. Apparently, Stone was someone the Soviet KGB talked to often enough in the 1930s to have a code name for him. <br><br>Bass's lead: "I.F. Stone,  writer of truth to power, hero to generations of independent journalists... and Soviet agent?" The tale starts with a new Yale University Press book, <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300123906">Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America,</a>
particularly a handful of pages about Stone, whose career Paul sums up neatly:&nbsp; <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Few survivors of the great 20th century political wars have remained
as revered as Stone. He was a dogged reporter, a culler of public
documents, a courageous defier of McCarthyism. He wrote passionate
editorials for the once-liberal <em>New York Post</em>. He was a mainstay of the great newspaper experiment of the century, <em>PM</em>.&nbsp; When McCarthy's crowd drove many liberal writers out of business or
underground, Stone refused to buckle. He published his own sheet, <em><a href="http://www.ifstone.org/">I.F. Stone's Weekly</a></em>. It became a legend that continues to inspire independent journalists, and now bloggers.</p><p>Bloggers? In fact, Dan Froomkin at Harvard's Nieman Foundation has called Stone <a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=100236">the best blogger ever</a>, even though Stone died a decade before the first blogs were blogged. See Froomkin's review of a different book <span class="content-nr-sidebar"><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.ifstone.org/macpherson.php">All Governments Lie!</a> The Life and Times of Rebel Journalist I.F. Stone </span><em></em></span> by <span class="bodytext">Myra MacPherson. </span>Also, here's an excerpt from that book: <a href="http://www.ifstone.org/biography-refuted.php">The importance of being Izzy and the death of dissent in journalism</a>. <br></p><p>Marking the 2007 centennial of Stone's birth, Harvard's Nieman Foundation launched an <a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/NiemanFoundation/Awards/AwardsAtAGlance/IFStoneMedalForJournalisticIndependence.aspx">I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence</a>, presenting the first one last October. I don't see anything on the Harvard site about a 2009 award, or responding to the Yale Press book about what Stone did or didn't say to KGB spies 70 years ago. I hope this doesn't turn into some kind of Yale-Harvard game, but if it does get people reading, thinking and talking, that's OK too.<br></p><p>Until I've read more, I'll agree with Eric Alterman's <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-04-22/slandering-if-stone/p/"><em>Daily Beast</em></a> characterization to Stone's activities in the 1930s: <br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">"A man of avowed anti-Fascist sympathies,
still-foolishly na&iuml;ve about Stalin and the Soviet Union, agreed on a
couple of occasions to help those whom he believed to be actually
fighting fascism, while his own country, still mired in childish
isolationism, looked away."</p><p>I.F. Stone led a long and productive life as a journalist, never disguised his left-leaning political sympathies, and inspired a generation of reporters to dig into public records, look for facts and contradictions, maintain their independence, and speak their minds. It would have been wonderful if he had also written an "apologia" for whatever dealings he had with the Soviets before World War II, or for not thoroughly denouncing the Soviet system before the mid-fifties, but I think his career is transparent enough. As the site for his (downloadable) <a href="http://www.ifstone.org/collected_writings.php">collected writings</a> says, "Izzy Stone was a reporter, a radical, an idealist, a scholar and, it is

(See the Washington Times and L.A. Times in the example at the left.) <br><br>And now there's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/timeswire/">TimesWire</a>, a page similar to my old "Atex" in-basket on the newsroom editing system, c. 1980.

Back when Jimmy Carter was president, anyone with a big computer
downstairs and tens of thousands of dollars in wire service
subscriptions could read a daily "river of news" on our computer
screens. (The people I'm talking about were editors at daily
newspapers. I was compiling a daily page two "People" column using wire
news, so I got one of the first wave of terminals at <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hartford Courant</span>.)<br><br>We
could scroll down through all the days stories in reverse-chronological
order, even split the screen to compare the AP and UPI wire stories
about the same event, then move paragraphs back and forth to create a
"combined wires" story. You could choose whether to just browse the
headlines, or expand them all to whatever number of lines of the story
would give you enough information. It still felt very "Buck Rogers" as
late as 1979! When I went back to grad school that year, I was
disappointed to find that the university's computer terminals couldn't
do anything like ATEX. Most of them didn't even do upper-and-lower-case
letters. Times &amp; technology do change.<br><br><br>

In the same "crowded hour" of the award announcement last month, a powerful Florida politician was being indicted by a grand jury, based on another St. Petersburg Times story, while yet another investigative project - - on abuse at a reform school - - was being posted on the paper's TampaBay.com site.<br><br>The Web also played a big part in those Pulitzers -- one for the paper's <a href="http://PolitiFact.com">PolitiFact.com</a> election coverage and online database,  the other for a simultaneously heart-breaking and heart-warming story about a horribly neglected girl and the adoptive parents who changed her life. That story, a long-form journalistic narrative titled "The Girl in the Window," is probably most read story the Times has produced, Brown said, estimating it has had well over a million readers in print and online. <br><br>(I posted more <a href="http://boblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/not-only-usual-suspects-win-pulitzers.html">links about the Pulitzer winners</a> last month.)<br></div></div><br>
