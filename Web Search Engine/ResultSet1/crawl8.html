The commission was established to examine the vociferous claims of business and the aviation industry that extra airport capacity in the UK, and specifically London, was needed – but to report only after the 2015 general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of MPs in west London, led by Conservative Zac Goldsmith, believe the government is deliberately concealing its intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balls in a recent speech to the CBI said he would like to see the Davies Commission make recommendations before the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party's previous shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, was shifted in the recent shadow cabinet reshuffle partly due to disagreements with Balls over HS2 and Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eagle's replacement as shadow transport secretary, Mary Creagh, has tried to be non-committal towards Davies, saying: "No party can say now that it will implement its recommendations when we simply don't know what the costs of any proposals will be. Obviously the Conservatives and Lib Dems haven't made any such commitments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour would not rule any runway options in or out while the Davies commission was still deliberating, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Miliband was a minister in the last Labour government that approved plans for a third runway, his concerns were well established. At one point he threatened to resign as energy secretary if Heathrow was granted a third runway, citing the effect on carbon emissions, and as leader he ruled out the party standing by its former policy after the coalition scrapped the runway in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour declined to comment on the report of a new Labour willingness to accept extra airport capacity in the south-east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davies will announce the shortlist on 17 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four-runway hub airport proposal to the east of London championed by mayor Boris Johnson – either in the Thames Estuary airport or at a revamped Stansted – was regarded as an expensive and unlikely choice, even before claims surfaced that it would be omitted from the shortlist. On Wednesday, the mayor vowed to keep fighting for his alternative, saying: "I have participated in this process in good faith, despite increasing concerns about its methodology. If only three options are left on the table, all beginning with the word Heathrow, that would be scandalous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/heathrow-third-runway"&gt;Heathrow third runway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edballs"&gt;Ed Balls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry"&gt;Airline industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport"&gt;Travel and transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/heathrow"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/air-transport"&gt;Air transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwyntopham"&gt;Gwyn Topham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Manufacturers pay for clinical trials of their products before they can go on sale to adults over 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers are expected to stop short of adopting the New Zealand approach but will consider the merits of regulating rather than criminalising the new drugs. Under the existing 12-month banning orders, possession of the legal highs for personal use actually remains legal although there are draconian penalties for importing and supplying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the review, which is due to report next spring to pave the way for new legislation, is expected to be welcomed by drug law reform campaigners who argue that the current system of banning each substance as it appears on the market is clearly untenable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea is not the only one that will be considered – the American example of "analogue" legislation which simply automatically bans any new substance that has a similar chemical structure to an already banned drug will also be examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many new legal highs are synthesised in laboratories in south-east Asia and designed to imitate the effects of existing illegal drugs including cannabis and ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to fresh legislation is being driven by the new Liberal Democrat drugs minister, Norman Baker, who has been alarmed at the rapid spread of legal highs with supplies available not just over the internet but increasingly from convenience stores and petrol stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review will look at how the UK's laws, and enforcement against, legal highs can be improved. Options include the expansion of legislation to ensure police and law enforcement agencies have better tailored powers. But the move is being announced on the same day that a permanent ban comes into effect on two 'legal highs' currently under temporary banning orders, NBOMe and Benzo Fury, which will become class A and class B substances respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker, the crime prevention minister, said: "The coalition government is determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so-called legal highs, which has tragically already claimed the lives of far too many young people in our country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite being marketed as legal alternatives to banned drugs, users cannot be sure of what they contain and the impact they will have on their health. Nor can they even be sure that they are legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our review will consider how current legislation can be better tailored to enable the police and law enforcement officers to combat this dangerous trade and ensure those involved in breaking the law are brought to justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review follows an international study of the drug laws initiated by Baker's predecessor as the Liberal Democrat drugs minister, Jeremy Browne, which is due to report in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of reference of the review will "identify legislative options for enhancing the government's response; consider the opportunities and risks of any new ideas identified, informed by international and other evidence; and make a clear recommendation for an effective and sustainable UK-wide legislative response to new psychoactive substances".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review is to be accompanied by new guidance to local authorities on enforcing trading standards legislation against shops selling the new psychoactive substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Kushlik, of the drug campaign, Transform, said they were delighted an evidence-based review was to take place: "Finally sense is prevailing as the prohibition based-system succumbs to the overwhelming deluge of new powerfully psychoactive drugs of literally infinite variety. The authorities are left chasing shadows, as the prohibition itself acts as the catalyst to develop new drugs, with each new chemical variation filling the vacuum created by the ban on the last drug to appear on the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the New Zealand example of a legal regulatory regime of less dangerous products needed to be explored: "It is to the great credit of the Home Office that it is prepared to look beyond prohibition, and toward alternatives that will provide basic health and safety for otherwise vulnerable users,."said Kushlik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/drugspolicy"&gt;Drugs policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugs"&gt;Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/drugs-trade"&gt;Drugs trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alantravis"&gt;Alan Travis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Some of the problems were so serious that patients' safety was endangered, with some potentially at risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people received an excellent service, more than a third of surgeries (34%) failed to meet at least one of the required standards on good practice and protecting patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some surgeries inspectors found that Adrenalin and other emergency drugs, for use if a patient suffered a potentially fatal anaphylactic shock, were out of date. "Because of that the drugs might not have worked. For me that's very serious. Someone in anaphylactic shock could have died," said Professor Steve Field, the NHS chief inspector of family doctor services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field and his team found management of medicines to be inadequate in 45 (23.3%) of the 193 surgeries where the procedures were inspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CQC cited the example of the Norris Road surgery in Sale, Cheshire, which it said did not have adequate medicines management policies and procedures. "We found a number of medicines used to treat patients in emergency situations were past their expiry date and also found some vaccines stored in the fridge that were six months out of date," the CQC's inspection report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have been published following an unprecedented number of inspections as part of a crackdown on standards of all NHS and social care. Overall, though, Field said, "many people receive good quality care from their GP".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From April the CQC will introduce more inquisitive and robust inspections of surgeries, which will include a CQC inspector, a GP, trainee GP and practice nurse or practice manager. Inspectors will visit all of the NHS's 211 clinical commissioning groups once every six months, inspecting a quarter of the practices in that area. In addition, from next October all GP surgeries in England will start being given an Ofsted-style rating for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said many of the 1,000 surgeries had already been identified as a concern and that major failings were isolated incidents. "Patients should expect high quality and consistent care from their GP practice, and the vast majority of practices do an excellent job of delivering quality care while maintaining the highest possible standards," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Wolds practice in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, some patients' drug records were found to be "incomplete", [and] "there were shortfalls in the security of medicines at the practice" and, in addition, "there had been a series of dispensing errors [at the surgery's pharmacy] where some patients had received medicines incorrectly." Among other findings, Field also warned about the potential dangers of GPs or practice nurses injecting patients with out of date, and potentially ineffective, vaccines, with children at particular risk. In such a situation a woman who thought she had been correctly vaccinated against German measles as a girl could, when pregnant, give birth to a deaf and blind baby because she did not in fact have immunity against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients not correctly immunised could later become "very, very poorly and then die", said Field. "That could affect many hundreds of patients in single surgeries. If they've not tracked it for years, that's a major problem. You're talking about problems which can damage this generation and the next generation", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hygiene and infection control were problematic in 76 (21.9%) of the 347 surgeries where the issue was examined. At the Dale Surgery in Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, inspectors found maggots, dead insects and dust and cobwebs. Inspectors had "serious concerns with the standards of cleanliness and infection control at the surgery, which included an infestation of pests".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery, which was otherwise rated as good, took immediate action to improve hygiene, although no system for regular monitoring was put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in three practices did not keep patients' electronic records up to date, which could mean that a patient may not be called for a blood test at the right time.At the Norris Road surgery, run by Dr Michael Florin, "we found confidential records left unattended or not securely storied in a number of areas of the practice". One in 12 (8.2%) surgeries has too few GPs, nurses or people to act as chaperones when female patients are undergoing certain types of examination. At Dr Syed's practice in Rochdale, Lancashire, "there were not enough qualified, skilled and experienced staff to safeguard people's health, safety and welfare." In some places staff had not undergone a criminal records bureau check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost one-in-eight (11.7%) surgeries offer patients no set way to complain. At another 12% of surgeries, staff did not know how to deal with safeguarding children or vulnerable adults – for example who to refer concerns to if a girl said she was being abused by a family member. At the King Street surgery in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, staff's lack of training on that "meant that patients were not protected from the risk of abuse because the provider had not taken reasonable steps to identify the possibility of abuse and prevent it from happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspectors judged almost one-in-four (24.1%) GPs' premises to be either unsafe or unsuitable, for example because they had access that made entry hard for people with mobility problems, such as stairs but no ramp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty getting appointments is a common problem, Field added. At the Kingshurst medical practice in Birmingham, for example, patients queued outside and even brought chairs to sit on in their quest to see a GP, with one patient having to wait 90 minutes to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said tougher inspections "will root out poor standards and celebrate the best".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jamie Reed, the shadow health minister said: "Nobody expects this poor level of care when visiting their family doctor. Patients at these surgeries are being badly let down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: "GP services make up the vast majority of public interactions with the health and social care system, so it is vital that access is fair to all, and that practices are carefully monitored to ensure that they are providing a high quality service for patients living in that community. Out-of-hours care must operate effectively, efficiently, safely and compassionately in the best interests of the patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/gps"&gt;GPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/doctors"&gt;Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/policy"&gt;Public services policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/deniscampbell"&gt;Denis Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But it is likely that the impact will be "appreciably smaller", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney has argued that the recent recovery has been boosted by the Bank's promise not to raise interest rates until the unemployment rate has fallen to 7%. But Weale said: "I find it inconceivable that, without forward guidance, I, or any of my colleagues, would have already voted to raise bank rate and that the only thing that has stopped us is forward guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "To the extent that the policy simply represents the way the MPC had behaved before it was announced, then, while bank rate might well stay at 0.5% into 2016 or beyond, it would do that in circumstances where, broadly speaking, it would have done it anyway. In that case the impact of the policy might be negligible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weale was the only one of the MPC's nine members to dissent from the details of the forward guidance policy when it was decided in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also broke ranks with the governor about the significance of the 7% unemployment target. Carney has been at pains to stress that an unemployment rate of 7% or lower would merely be a signal for the MPC to reassess the economic outlook. But Weale said: "My own view is that if unemployment is falling rapidly at the time that it drops to 7%, that will be an indication that demand is strong relative to supply, strengthening the case for an early rate rise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney hopes that by sending a message that the Bank is in no hurry to push up rates even as the economy strengthens, he can prevent the upturn being choked off by fears of higher borrowing costs. Instead, he plans to rely on so-called "macroprudential" policies – such as constraining mortgage lending – to prevent bubbles emerging as recovery takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the forward guidance policy is hedged around with "knockouts" – including caveats over inflation and financial stability – that have also drawn criticism. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory chairman of the Treasury select committee, complained to Carney earlier this year that it would be hard to explain the policy "down the Dog and Duck".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further doubt has been cast on the policy by drastic shifts in the MPC's forecasts as the economy has strengthened. Between its August and November quarterly projections, the MPC brought forward by 18 months the date at which it expects the 7% unemployment threshold to be hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weale found through interviews with investors that they were expecting interest rates to be 0.25% lower in two years than they might otherwise have expected, as a result of forward guidance. That could boost GDP by up to 0.75%, he said – but only if the policy was well understood by households, as well as in the City. "Unless people have taken an unusual interest in what my colleagues and I have said about policy, it seems to me likely that the initial effects will be appreciably smaller".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney"&gt;Mark Carney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth"&gt;Economic growth (GDP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart"&gt;Heather Stewart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The eMarketer estimate tops previous predictions. In May, Morgan Stanley predicted that YouTube's gross revenues would reach $4bn in 2013, while Barclays suggested a likely figure of $3.6bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has not revealed YouTube's earnings, but eMarketer research suggests that the search engine got a bargain when it paid $1.65bn for the site in 2006. However, YouTube does not keep all the advertising revenue and must pay a share to advertising partners and providers of content. Google's public statistics for YouTube include the fact that the service attracts 1 billion people watching more than 6bn hours of video a month, with 80% of its traffic coming from outside the US, and 40% of its viewing time happening on mobile devices. Advertisers are keen to buy slots on YouTube because of its young audience, who prefer to watch TV programmes through their computers, tablets and mobile phones rather than conventional televisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising"&gt;Advertising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stuart-dredge"&gt;Stuart Dredge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the compulsory core subjects of English, maths and science, genetics accounted for on average 58% of the differences in scores that children achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grades in the sciences, such as physics, biology and chemistry, were more heritable than those in humanities subjects, such as art and music, at 58% and 42% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings do not mean that children's performance at school is determined by their genes, or that schools and the child's environment have no influence. The overall effect of a child's environment – including their home and school life – accounted for 36% of the variation seen in students' exam scores across all subjects, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question we are asking is why do children differ in their GCSE scores? People immediately think it's schools. But if schools accounted for all the variance, then children in one classroom would all be the same," said &lt;a href="http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/staff/profile/default.aspx?go=10628" title=""&gt;Robert Plomin&lt;/a&gt;, an expert in behavioural genetics who led the study at King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tease out the genetic contribution to children's school grades, the researchers studied GCSE scores of identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) and non-identical twins (who share on average half of the genes that normally vary between people). Both groups share their environments to a similar extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the twins' exam scores allowed the scientists to work out how much of the variation was down to genetics, and how much to environment. For example, when identical twins get different GCSE scores, the cause cannot be genetic, so it must be what scientists call "non-shared environment" effects – such as the better student having a better teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child's performance is influenced, but not set, by their DNA. While one child may excel, their identical twin may not. But taking an average over the population studied, around half of the variation in GCSE scores was due to genetics, Plomin found. Details of the study appear in the journal, &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/" title=""&gt;Plos One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in the journal, the authors point out that genetics emerges as such a strong influence on exam scores because the schooling system aims to give all children the same education. The more school and other factors are made equal, the more genetic differences come to the fore in children's performance. The same situation would happen if everyone had a healthy diet: differences in bodyweight would be more down to genetic variation, instead of being dominated by lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plomin said one message from the study was that differences in children's performance were not merely down to effort. "Some children find it easier to learn than others do, and I think it's appetite as much as aptitude," he said. "There is a motivation, maybe because you like to do what you are good at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics, he said, caused people to create, select and modify their environment, and so nature drives nurture, which in turn reinforces nature. A child with a gift for maths seeks friends who like maths. A child who learns to read easily might join a book club, and work through books on the shelves at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/staff/CPAT/GEMS_71.html" title=""&gt;Michael Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, professor of science education at the Institute of Education in London, said that while genetics undoubtedly plays a role in educational performance, the information might not be very useful. "Some people have to wear glasses because of genetic defects, and other people wear them for reasons that have nothing to do with genetics. As long as you are wearing glasses in school, it doesn't matter at all. The genetics is utterly irrelevant," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past 10 years, programmes have been developed that help children who have fallen behind with their reading to catch up. The programme does not rely on genetics, but focuses on the particular problems the children have in reading. "It doesn't matter if you're teaching maths, rowing or the trombone. A good teacher is very sensitive to the individual needs of the learner, and I don't think the genetics is going to help very much with that," Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plomin said that educational performance could be affected by thousands of genes, each of which has a minuscule effect. Finding them will be tough, but would allow scientists to work out which gene variants affect performance in different subject areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might produce problems of its own though. "The worry is that parents, teachers and children themselves start thinking 'It's not worth my while trying, I don't have the genes for it', but that's false logic. The big problem is equating genetics with determinism. It's a very powerful [misconception] and difficult to shift," said Reiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plomin believes that education might be improved by enlarging schools so they have enough resources to offer children a greater range of subjects and activities, so each can find out what they are good at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Education is still focused on a one-size-fits-all approach and if genetics tells us anything it's that children are different in how easily they learn and what they like to learn. Forcing them into this one academic approach is going to make some children confront failure a lot and it doesn't seem a wise approach. It ought to be more personalised," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These things are as heritable as anything in behaviour, and yet when you look in education or in educational textbooks for teachers there is nothing on genetics. It cannot be right that there's this complete disconnect between what we know and what we do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/genetics"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/gcses"&gt;GCSEs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/exams"&gt;Exams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/iansample"&gt;Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Clowns and a samba band amused the crowds and there was no obvious police presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on, students broke through closed gates into an area alongside the University of London Senate building in Bloomsbury, with shouts of "cops out, students in".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the protest, demonstrators also set a bin on fire, attacked a police vehicle, let off flares and chanted: "Students and workers – unite and fight", and "No justice, no peace, fuck the police".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Chessum, of the National Association against Cuts and Fees, said: "There is something brewing on a national level, which we haven't seen in a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As well as police presence on campus, we're protesting against workers' struggles, campus democracy, and we have a generalised anti-privatisation message."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protest moved through Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Hyde Park Corner and Holborn. Many took to Twitter to show their support using the hashtag #copsoffcampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students, academics and university workers from around the country travelled to the capital to take part in the demonstration, as well as setting up similar rallies across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadine El-Enany, law lecturer at Birkbeck, said: "Staff are here to show their solidarity with students and to show that our fight is the same fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Students support us on the picket lines when we've been on strike before in recent weeks, so we're here to support students who are brutalised by police. I think the fight is going to continue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isobel Urquhart, a Cambridge academic, said: "There seems to be more understanding of the needs for staff and students to combine and there's more effort now to involve staff workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student union officers from Bristol also took part in the protest and wore Christmas outfits and brandished festive banners in a bid to highlight peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellie Williams, of Bristol students union, said: "We're wearing our Christmas jumpers and Christmas hats because there seems to be an atmosphere around protesting that is quite angry, masculine and aggressive and we wanted to challenge that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Glinecki, a Cambridge graduate who attended the protest, said: "The police have provoked this. Their heavy-handed tactics have brought more people out onto the streets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protest comes just a day after Sussex University unexpectedly lifted its ban on five students – known as the 'Farthing Five', after the university's vice-chancellor – who had taken part in protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adriano Marotta, one of the students who was suspended, was at the protest. He said: "We want our voices to be heard. We feel like the police are trying to silence student groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/studentpolitics"&gt;Student politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/students"&gt;Students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education"&gt;Higher education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest"&gt;Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/abby-young-powell"&gt;Abby Young-Powell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"I remember they were both very busy trying to finish off the last details of their splashes, their front covers, for their respective papers – on their phones, texting, emailing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, she told the jury, Morgan had said to Brooks: "I already know what your splash, or your cover, is going to be because I have been listening to your messages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Brooks had replied: "Been hacking my phone again, have you, Piers?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitham said: "He said something along the lines: 'Well, you've been looking at my emails.' It was quite a quick, back-and-forth bantering, her saying to him: 'I have left a false trail, I have led you up the garden path.' Him saying: 'I've done the same on you.' It was pointed. It was like truth said in jest. There was a pointedness to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitham, who told the jury she was working for Schillings law firm at the time, said she had been nervous at the dinner and so had deliberately drunk very little in order to avoid making a fool of herself. "I was quite nervous to be around all these people. These were pretty much the most powerful people in the media industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had made small talk with Brooks, who had suggested they should stay in touch in the hope that they could find amicable settlements for any future disputes between Schillings clients and her newspaper. "I thought that was a good idea because I was taking on more responsibility at work, so I went to give her my number on a piece of paper, and Piers said: 'Careful, she'll tap your phone.' I must have looked a bit scared and pulled a funny face, because Rebekah said: 'Don't worry. Let me give you my number.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-examined by Claire Sibson for Brooks, Sitham agreed that she had not reported this conversation to Schillings, nor made any note of it at the time. The jury were shown a blogpost published by Sitham in November 2012, headed "And the truth shall set you free", in which she had described her difficulty in deciding whether to say anything public about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation came to a head, and six weeks ago led me to find myself in a discreet cafe with Hugh Grant, Evan Harris of the Hacked Off campaign and Nick Davies of the Guardian in a scene not dissimilar to a Richard Curtis film, apart from the fact that this was very much real life and no laughing matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibson put it to Sitham she had "fictionalised" her account. Sitham replied: "Absolutely not. As God is my witness, everything I have told you is the truth and to the best of my recollection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The truth is this conversation didn't happen, did it?" said Sibson. "It did," replied Sitham. The former lawyer was challenged about her recollection of events, and it was suggested that the dinner had taken place a year later, in January 2004. Sitham was asked if she remembered any discussion on the night of the Hutton report, a report into events surrounding the death of the Iraqi weapons inspector David Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not. Sibson put it to Sitham that the dinner took place on the eve of the report being published in 2004 and the reason why there was a pointedness to the conversation was because Morgan was angry that "the Sun had come by a leaked copy of the report", scooping the Mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks denies conspiring to intercept communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll"&gt;Lisa O'Carroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The committee is conducting an inquiry into counter-terrorism and cross-examined Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor-in-chief, last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May told the home affairs select committee chairman, Keith Vaz, that she had rejected the request for Parker to give evidence because his appearance would "duplicate" the existing oversight provided by the ISC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cameron rejected the request for Darroch to give evidence on the basis that his role focused on providing private advice to him and the national security council and his appearance would "set a difficult precedent".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said it should be left to the home secretary to give evidence to the MPs on their concerns about counter-terrorism and the Guardian's disclosures of mass digital surveillance by GCHQ and the US national security agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision prompted a furious reaction from Vaz, who said: "The prime minister has suggested that the home secretary should come before us to answer our questions and Theresa May is suggesting that it is a matter for the Intelligence and Security Committee. We cannot play pass the parcel on the issue of accountability on these important issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ministers should take care not to dictate to parliamentary committees which witnesses can be called and for what reasons. Witnesses, no matter how senior, should not be afraid of answering questions from MPs. As a result of this correspondence, our session with the home secretary next Monday will be longer and more detailed than we originally anticipated, and she needs to prepare to come before the committee more often."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farron, meanwhile, challenged the value of the ISC. He said: "It is a group of the great and good. Experienced hands. 'Sound men' as Sir Humphrey might put it. When the programs systemically collecting your personal information are so secret that even the cabinet are not aware of their existence, our democratic oversight has rescinded to the point of extinction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farron and Julian Huppert, a Lib Dem member of the home affairs select committee, met Microsoft, Google and Twitter this week to discuss the common approach the internet firms have been taking in the United States to demand greater privacy for their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lib Dem president is interested in promoting a digital bill of rights, warning that "pervasive surveillance of our entire digital lives has been allowed to take place without prior knowledge, debate or consent".In its inquiry, the ISC is asking witnesses whether internet communications can be treated differently from other forms of surveillance, such as closed-circuit television cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay"&gt;Theresa May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity"&gt;UK security and counter-terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alantravis"&gt;Alan Travis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

President Viktor Yanukovych has struggled to contain protests since he ducked out of signing an integration agreement with the EU last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, who visited the square after meeting Yanukovych on Tuesday, expressed outrage at the attempt to clear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really do condemn the use of force, it's totally unacceptable," said Ashton, who held an emergency meeting with ambassadors of EU countries in Kiev on Wednesday. "Especially when I had a chance to see how people are demonstrating peacefully. I think people of this great country deserve better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister, Mykola Azarov, claimed that the police action was simply meant to clear roads. "No force will be applied against peaceful protesters. Do you understand this? Calm down," he said at a government meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was condemnation from around the world. Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlbildt/status/410661410599751680" title=""&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: "Eurasia versus Europe in streets of Kiev tonight. Repression versus reform. Power versus people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of state, John Kerry, released a strongly worded statement expressing "disgust" at the government moves, and on Wednesday morning Kerry's deputy, Victoria Nuland, visited Independence Square and handed out biscuits to protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests, now in their third week, culminated on Sunday in the biggest demonstration in Ukraine since the 2004 Orange Revolution. Hundreds of thousands of people paralysed the centre of Kiev, and the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/ukraine-opposition-viktor-yanukovych-european-integration" title=""&gt;city's statue of Vladimir Lenin was toppled and hacked to pieces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ukrainian delegation is expected in Brussels on Thursday to discuss &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/ukraine-european-union-pact-viktor-yanukovych" title=""&gt;renewing negotiations on the integration pact&lt;/a&gt;. Azarov said he had asked the EU for €20bn (£17bn) in aid to help Ukraine's economy through the integration process, a figure many times higher than what is likely to be on offer. Russia is believed to have offered aid and cheaper gas if Kiev abstains from signing, and financial woe if Yanukovych does put pen to paper on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ukraine is split between the Russian-speaking east and the more pro-European west, Yanukovych's corruption-riddled government is unpopular across the country. The EU deal simply provided the lit match sparking broader protests against the government. Independence Square, hub of the Orange Revolution, has become the focal point of discontent, with pitched tents, food stands and a stage blaring out music and revolutionary speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's storming of the barricades came in the dead of the coldest night this year as temperatures plummeted to -13C . Shortly after 1am, battalions of police approached the vast square from all sides and began to dismantle the makeshift barricades that had been erected by protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several officers confirmed they had been given orders to clear barricades from the boundaries of the square but not remove the tent camp that has sprung up inside the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiercest battle came on the north side of the square, where hundreds of black-helmeted riot police struggled for several hours against lines of protesters wearing orange helmets distributed by organisers, in scenes that threatened to descend into all-out pitched battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many police were trapped behind protester lines during the scuffles, and were saved only by the relative restraint of protesters, who set them free and even handed back their shields, only for police to launch new assaults. Eventually chainsaws were used to clear the barbed-wire-topped wooden barriers and hundreds of riot police moved into the square itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barricades were removed and hundreds of police took up positions on the square as dawn broke. However, they soon disappeared entirely from the city centre, leaving protesters to rebuild the barricades that had been dismantled just hours earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Kiev city hall, which has been occupied by protesters for 10 days, buses packed with riot police drove up mid-morning on Wednesday prepared to reclaim the building but were repelled by protesters spraying them with water, using fire hoses from first-floor windows. A huge crowd gathered outside taunting the riot police, who remained stuck in their buses for an hour before driving away to joyous chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am completely sick of this government and this president," said 42-year-old Mykola Levchenko, who on Wednesday evening was helping to put the finishing touches to a new barricade of snow-filled sandbags and metal railings at one entrance to the square. "We are going to stand here until he resigns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tension remained high in Kiev throughout Wednesday, and police briefly closed both the city's airports and the main train station after receiving bomb threats. Yanukovych said he was ready to talk with the opposition, but Vitali Klitschko, the former heavyweight boxing champion and one of the main opposition leaders, said that only the president's resignation and snap parliamentary and presidential elections would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was the most stupid thing the authorities could have done," Klitschko told the Guardian early on Wednesday morning. "To clear out the square when Catherine Ashton is in town. People here are determined not to live in a police state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest"&gt;Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/shaun-walker"&gt;Shaun Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/oksana-grytsenko"&gt;Oksana Grytsenko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Officials were criticised for failing to close an expensive 0845 helpline for students seeking advice over their loans and chastised for failing to have basic facts at their fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee heard that in 2010 it had been estimated that 28% of money lent would not be repaid; by 2013, that figure had risen to 35%, and it could now be as high as 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Hodge, the committee's chair, said the resource accounting and budgeting (Rab) charge, which is the proportion of loans issued that Bis does not expect to be repaid, involved "massive cost to the public purse" and would be close to 40%. Donnelly replied: "At the moment, that's at the top end of our estimates but it is not unrealistic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hodge questioned whether plans to offload £900m of student loans for £160m would give the taxpayer value for money, Donnelly replied that "getting through the value-for-money test was absolutely vital". She said she doubted that it would be, and asked for a note to be sent to the committee clarifying his position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donnelly also disclosed that there were now 40,000 students on Higher National Certificate (HNC) and Higher National Diploma (HND) courses at private colleges. That increase had caused some concern at the department, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another witness, Mick Laverty, the Student Loans Company chief executive, was asked why he had failed to close a helpline for students that charged 41p a minute from a mobile phone, despite officials having been asked to consider alternatives at a previous PAC meeting in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Bacon, a senior Tory committee member, said: "Why should students, many of whom are struggling, be charged the cost of a meal to phone you, given that your organisation has assets worth billions?" Laverty replied that he hoped to have found an alternative by April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laverty then updated the MPs on an investigation into finance provided to Romanian and Bulgarian students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The universities minister, David Willetts, last month froze payments to students from the two countries at "alternative providers", such as private colleges, amid suspicions about eligibility for student support loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, 92 cases had been identified as ineligible, Laverty said, and efforts would be made to claw the money back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have currently suspended all payments to what we call A2 applicants, that's students who are applicants from Romania and Bulgaria at what is termed alternative providers. That applies to around 7,500 students," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did that specifically because we were picking up in our analytic work at the Student Loan Company quite high instances of those applications or those applicants at alternative providers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we sit here today, we have completed 35% of that exercise, so we have reviewed 2,635 individual cases and we have cleared 839. That's 11% of the overall total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think, out of the ones we have looked at so far, 92 cases – so that's 1.2% of the overall total – are ineligible. And that process is continuing on a daily basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the National Audit Office (NAO) produced a critical report that suggested over £5bn of public money paid out in student loans was unaccounted for because the government had insufficient information about the recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found around 368,000 students who have borrowed money for whom the business departmenthad no current UK employment record or other details on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be because they are unemployed students living in the UK, EU students who have returned home, or UK students who have moved overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It means that the government lacks the information to decide whether these students should be making repayments on their loans; and, if so, how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the current system, students repay their loans only when they are earning a certain annual salary – now set at £21,000 – and repayments are linked to their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAO's report concluded that this group had a total remaining debt of £5.3bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three members of the committee expressed their surprise at how poorly briefed their witnesses had been. "You have come deeply unprepared, guys," said Hodge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/students"&gt;Students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education"&gt;Higher education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaret-hodge"&gt;Margaret Hodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rajeev-syal"&gt;Rajeev Syal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He must make it clear that he is not the guiding light at the NoW behind everything GM did over the years. 'If I [Goodman] don't do that, I'm going to prison, it's as simple as that.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crone sent a second email to Coulson three days later to discuss the company's probable apology to those whom Mulcaire or Goodman may be found guilty of hacking. He said an apology could "tilt Mulcaire into reacting" and pointing to phone hacking that went wider than the royal family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Potential problem with the NoW/you apologising to specific individuals (the 3 involved in Clive's charges) is that it leads to the question.. Well are you going to apologise to all the others, for example the names in Mulcaire's extra charges. It would be very difficult question for us to ignore […] We could say that those 5 people are nothing to do with us […] Which could tilt Mulcaire into reacting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crone then mentioned others including Max Clifford and the MP Simon Hughes who at that time were alleged to have been hacked by Mulcaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also an apology to the Clive 3 might prompt Clifford or Simon Hughes or the others to say 'I too demand an apology from NoW editor'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coulson and others deny conspiring to intercept communications.

"First, the idea of an 11% pay rise in one year at a time of pay restraint is simply unacceptable," he told the Commons. "Secondly, Ipsa do need to think again, and unless they do so, I don't think anyone will want to rule anything out. No one wants to go back to MPs voting on their own pay but we have got to have a process and an outcome that can build public confidence. Third, in my view, I think this should all be accompanied with a cut in the cost of politics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a spokesman for Ipsa said the watchdog's view on MP pay would be published as planned on Thursday, after two years of work and research on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blogpost, Andrew McDonald, chief executive of Ipsa, called for people to look at research on MP remuneration instead of "shouting". He said the proposals would involve pension and expenses arrangements, not just pay, and claimed the public had a "more nuanced and split opinion" than many politicians suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously Downing Street had said the issue of MPs' pay "did not arise" until 2015 when there would be a review of Ipsa's decision, suggesting Cameron could be hoping that the dispute dies down until after the next election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Miliband warned the prime minister not to kick it into the long grass. In his letter to Cameron, he said: "The public expect us to resolve this now and not wait until 2015. It only undermines confidence and trust in our political system if the uncertainty about MPs' pay is allowed to continue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron has not so far agreed to official cross-party talks, but told the Labour leader his door was "always open" on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's rejection of Ipsa's likely recommendation was met with a frosty silence from his backbenchers in the Commons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tory MP Peter Lilley, a former minister, suggested Cameron revived boundary reforms blocked by the Liberal Democrats if he wanted to bring down the cost of politics; that could lead to fewer, better-paid, MPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/public-sector-pay"&gt;Public sector pay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-lilley"&gt;Peter Lilley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason"&gt;Rowena Mason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Earlier this year, just two of its 33 solo breakfast presenters were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there remain challenges ahead. BBC Radio 2, the country's most popular radio station, does not have a single full-time female presenter in its daytime schedule between 6.30am and 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Sound Women, the industry pressure group devoted to giving women a louder voice on the airwaves, said: "Sound Women welcomes the move from the BBC to increase the representation of women on air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As improvements are made, it would be great to see the BBC announce plans to further support women's progression and unleash potential in management behind the scenes as well, and for other media companies to follow suit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/11/bbc-peaktime-drama-current-affairs-governance-review" title=""&gt;carried out a review of the way it is governed&lt;/a&gt; after a string of controversies over multimillion-pound payoffs to senior management, the £100m Digital Media Initiative fiasco and the Savile scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culture secretary, Maria Miller, called on the BBC to act after &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/11/maria-miller-bbc-trust-annus-horribilis" title=""&gt;what she described as an "annus horribilis" for the corporation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, Patten and Hall admitted the corporation's management and regulation had become "too confused" with "too much overlap" between the two bodies. They said "people do not always know who is responsible when things go wrong". The BBC is increasing its number of non-executive directors from four to six, with the former Sony boss Sir Howard Stringer its first appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was continued fallout from the Savile scandal on Wednesday as the BBC Trust said it was standing by the findings of the former Sky News head Nick Pollard's report into the affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This came &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/11/bbc-lord-patten-jimmy-savile-inquiry-evidence" title=""&gt;after a tape recording was made public of Pollard telling a journalist that he had made a "mistake"&lt;/a&gt; in not including evidence from the then director of BBC News, Helen Boaden, that she had told the former director general Mark Thompson about the nature of Newsnight's shelved investigation into Savile's sex abuse in December 2011. Thompson maintains that he was unaware of the Savile allegations until he left the BBC in September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trust said it was "satisfied the conclusions of the report are robust" but said it was "regrettable that Nick Pollard had decided to try to correct the record through an off-the-record conversation with a journalist rather than raising this point directly with the BBC, who commissioned the report".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-trust"&gt;BBC Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/television"&gt;Television industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gender"&gt;Gender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnplunkett"&gt;John Plunkett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"We have to get it right because these people need the help as fast as they can get it," he told MPs on the work and pensions select committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of terminally ill cancer patients faced long waits of weeks and months to receive income support because of changes made to the way the system is administered after the government introduced PIP, which replaced disability living allowance, earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously a claim for the benefit took eight to 10 days, but cancer charities warned last month that payments were &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24784691" title=""&gt;taking as long as eight to 10 weeks to process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits director at the Department for Work and Pensions, Jason Feeney, said the service had not been "up to scratch".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the operational director for delivering PIP, I would absolutely say that the service that we gave for some terminally ill claimants at the beginning of PIP wasn't up to the standard, where we would be expecting it to be. I'm not going to try to pretend otherwise. There were some awful experiences that people went through," he told MPs. "The service wasn't where we wanted it to be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a number of changes to the process had been made to ensure that long delays were avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penning, who has been minister for disabled people since September, said he wanted terminally ill people to be able to make the claim and receive the payment within a seven-day period, but added that he was reluctant to introduce targets to ensure that this time frame was met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how he was going to enforce the seven-day goal without targets, he replied: "My size 10 boots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a passion about this. Not just because it's something that has touched my life, but because it is a moral position," he said. "While I am the minister, I want to see seven days. I can't see why we can't achieve seven days or even less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duleep Allirajah, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "Terminally ill cancer patients are facing severe delays in receiving their benefits under the new personal independence payment special rules claim. We know that a quarter of our benefits advisers surveyed have come across someone who has died before receiving their benefit – this is simply deplorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have raised these concerns with the government and are hopeful that working together we can develop a solution. We want them to set targets to process all claims in eight to 10 days as a matter of urgency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/disability"&gt;Disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ameliagentleman"&gt;Amelia Gentleman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This is all too much testing too soon," Blower said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National tests for seven-year-olds were scrapped in 2004, replaced by teacher assessments, while national tests for 14-year-olds – key stage three – were dropped by the previous Labour government in 2009 after a fiasco involving marking and administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current government introduced a phonics test for pupils at the end of year one in primary school, while 11-year-olds take maths and reading tests at key stage two, with a new spelling, punctuation and grammar test added from May this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Talk to any good headteacher and they will tell you it was a mistake to abolish those tests. That's because good teachers use those tests to make sure every child learns well. In getting rid of the tests, we conceded too much ground to vested interests," Wilshaw said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our education system should be run for the benefit of children, and no one else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofsted had statistics from 30 infant schools that had been merged into standard primary schools, showing that the performance of key stage one pupils suffered once they were in primary schools. That suggested that primary schools put more energy into preparing pupils for key stage two tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Education recently held a consultation on tests for young pupils, offering a "baseline assessment" of either a test for four-year-olds entering reception class or tests for seven-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the DfE said: "The department launched a consultation on the primary accountability system and will be responding in due course. We expect teachers to take professional responsibility for the accurate assessment of pupils."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now 485,000 more primary school pupils and 180,000 more secondary school pupils attending good or outstanding schools compared with a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looking at the evidence across all sectors, there are unmistakable signs that England's education system is gradually improving," said Wilshaw, who attributed some of the improvement to Ofsted's abolition of the "satisfactory" inspection grade being replaced by the notification "requires improvement".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief inspector also announced that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/11/schools-surprise-visits-ofsted-behaviour" title=""&gt;Ofsted inspectors would begin making "no notice" visits&lt;/a&gt; to schools identified as rife with poor behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Classrooms must be orderly places. Around 700,000 pupils attend schools where behaviour needs to improve," Wilshaw said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilshaw gave a nod of approval to the academy programme introduced by Labour in 2007 and expanded under Gove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Academies are undoubtedly making a big difference. Well-established sponsored academies in deprived areas have made particularly impressive progress," Wilshaw said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/ofsted"&gt;Ofsted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/education"&gt;Education policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/exams"&gt;Exams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardadams"&gt;Richard Adams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Smoking cannabis is more carcinogenic than smoking tobacco," the INCB statement added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/drugs-trade"&gt;Drugs trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/cannabis"&gt;Cannabis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugs"&gt;Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Caroline Flint, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: "Higher energy bills are one of the main reasons people are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ONS said the harsh winters of 2011 and 2012 were also likely to have played a part in driving up energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the lowest-income families the jump in costs meant they spent 25% of their income on housing, compared with 9% among the richest households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower-income families cut spending on food by almost £1 a week after inflation, according to the ONS, figures that will add fuel to the "heating not eating" debate that is expected to dominate parliamentary discussion of the economy in the runup to the next election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the richest 10% of homes spent an average of £1,065.60 a week and the poorest 10% spent £189.30 a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ONS spokesman said families had offset some of the rise in housing costs by cutting down on car journeys, and food spending remained well down on its pre-recession peak. Furniture and garden tools were also singled out by the statistics body as areas where cutbacks had hurt sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending on recreation and culture has also fallen, though holidays and clothing were protected from austerity measures. "There is strong evidence that people are focusing more on essential items," the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ONS said weekly spending on petrol (£16.40) and diesel (£8.20) accounted for almost two-fifths of the transport costs. "The price of petrol increased substantially over this period, and it's likely that motorists have responded to this by reducing journeys," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Britain's biggest retailers said the continuing squeeze on family budgets meant they were braced for a difficult Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asda's marketing boss, Stephen Smith, said he expected that imminent rises in energy bills would constrain spending through the last few weeks of 2013 and into 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said the supermarket's research into its shoppers' behaviour showed that customers had spent 2% to 6% less of their total Christmas budget than they had at this point last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested customers were looking for bargains because they had no more disposable income than in 2012 and an average of £21 a month less than they had in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are improving and there is no doubt that the business environment is getting better but that is just not translating to disposable income for the masses," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of recent polls have shown that the relief surrounding the recent economic upturn is already beginning to wane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A YouGov online focus group of people from the "squeezed middle" found they were not yet feeling the benefits of growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephan Shakespeare, a YouGov spokesman, said: "The picture they painted of their own finances was far removed from the burgeoning economic recovery they've read about in the newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Participants all said they had cut down to near bare essentials and were feeling particular pressure being on such a tight budget for Christmas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a 44-year old airline administrator had commented: "I think [the economy recovery] is slight, so not very noticeable to us mere mortals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consumer confidence index by YouGov and the economic thinktank Cebr found that consumer optimism could be reaching a plateau. The report said many people relished the rising value of their home and reports of higher GDP growth but their household finances were not keeping pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research shows that following a year of economic growth, Britons are still three times more likely to save a cash windfall than spend it," said Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ONS annual survey, which is based on responses from 5,600 people, showed that a small rise spending on clothes and footwear in 2012 was part of a long-term trend. In 2001 consumers spent £15.30 a week on fashion items; in 2012 the figure had increased to £23.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London topped the spending league with an average weekly spend of £571.60, ahead of the south-east on £561.30. Households in the north-east spent the least at £408.70 a week, followed by Wales on £411.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/household-bills"&gt;Household bills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/energy"&gt;Energy bills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics"&gt;Office for National Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/phillipinman"&gt;Phillip Inman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler"&gt;Sarah Butler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"We've come to bid farewell to our father. The old man is taking a break. He worked hard and made a lot of changes to this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many in the queues that snaked through the streets of Pretoria were too young to remember apartheid and had come to see Mandela for the first and last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not Nyembe. "It was terrible. Wherever you went, you had to carry your ID with you. There was a butchery where the black people had their own doors where they bought from. At the post office black people would go to the back door for service. On the trains there would be a black section and a white section. At restaurants black men would have to buy takeaways because they weren't allowed to sit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997 Nyembe was a victim of the rise in violent crime that not even then president Mandela could stanch. He was shot six times during a hijacking, leaving him paralysed from the waist down. Four of the bullets are still in his body. The gunmen were never caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet he did not lose faith in the new South Africa. "Mandela helped me stay positive," he said. "That's why I'm living my life to the fullest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had seen Mandela at his last public appearance, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/11/world-cup-final-nelson-mandela" title=""&gt;the 2010 football World Cup final&lt;/a&gt;, but sadness consumed him on Wednesday as he approached the half-open casket. "Only now I believe he was gone," he said. "I knew they wouldn't lie when they said he passed away but I saw the body, I know it's him. I have to accept it. I think now the old man can rest in peace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nyembe was among thousands of men and women of all ages who spent most of the day queuing, riding buses – a moving carnival of foot-stamping, liberation struggle songs and cries of "Viva Nelson Mandela, viva!" – queuing some more, going through security checkpoints and then queuing again, with mostly good humour and patience, though tempers frayed and several people passed out in the afternoon heat. Still, South Africa got back the mojo that had &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/nelson-mandela-memorial-service-barack-obama" title=""&gt;gone missing at the official memorial service&lt;/a&gt; 24 hours earlier. A policeman told one restless queuer: "Mandela 27 years, you one hour!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nezi Maqungu, 53, from East London, said the lines zigzagging through the city – a riot of colour including football shirts and African National Congress regalia – reminded her of the first democratic election but with one crucial difference: "That was exciting whereas this is sad. We can't believe he's gone. There will never be another like him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The songs fell silent when people reached the austere amphitheatre of the Union Buildings, built in light sandstone a century ago and in the style of the ancients – the government describes it as a "modern-day acropolis" atop a hill. It was here that Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's first black president in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A temporary structure had been erected under a white canopy with chandeliers and decorated with giant bouquets of lilies. Mandela's grandson and heir Mandla, sombre in a long black coat and black tie, stood ramrod straight with eyes fixed on the middle distance. Four junior naval officers in brilliant white uniforms stood guard with swords pointing downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the centre was the casket with a glass bubble at the top revealing Mandela's familiar face and white hair, along with a characteristically vibrant shirt. Two rivers of people flowed by either side, not allowed to pause or take photographs, and not able to take their eyes off a face that so often smiled but was now stilled for ever. Some wept and some made the sign of the cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials estimated that an average of 2,000 people per hour passed the body. Among them was Gladness Nesane, 24, a healthcare technician who had waited five hours. "I felt like he's not real, like a statue inside the coffin," she said. "At least we saw the image of him. It's very sad knowing he'll never come back. He's just history and we'll never know anyone like him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norma Page, 57, a psychologist, said: "I'm speechless. It was a brief second, too short a moment after a long day. But it's part of walking the long walk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people were turned away but will get another chance to view Mandela on Thursday and Friday before he is buried in his ancestral village of Qunu on Sunday. The casket is kept at a military hospital overnight, then transported to the Union Buildings each morning. People lined the streets as an honour guard as the black hearse passed by on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graça Machel, in mourning black and now twice widowed, reportedly sobbed at the sight of Mandela in the casket. Other family members including his former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela also paid their respects. Then came singer Bono, model Naomi Campbell, South African president Jacob Zuma and his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe. FW de Klerk, South Africa's last white president, appeared to wipe away a tear as he passed the casket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed by British architect &lt;a href="http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-herbert-baker-architecture" title=""&gt;Sir Herbert Baker&lt;/a&gt;, the Union Buildings are redolent of South Africa's colonial past, their name referring to the union of British and Boers. Just below the amphitheatre a bronze sculpture of a horse and two men commemorates the first world war, while two vintage artillery guns point to the horizon. Elsewhere a bronze "1914-1918 roll of honour" begins with the names Acton, Adams, Adams, Adkins, Alen-Mahon, Allen, Anderson, Andrews, Antill, Archer and Arnold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps this setting was not entirely inappropriate for Mandela, a self-confessed anglophile who received a British education and, as Barack Obama has reminded mourners, was born during the first world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week the Union Buildings will mark their centenary – by unveiling a statue of Mandela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith"&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I'm really glad we are finally being treated equally and can now get married in our church." She hoped to marry her fiancé, Allesandro Calcioli, within a few months, though they had not yet set a date. Calcioli said he was "ecstatic".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hodkin's solicitor, Paul Hewitt, a partner at the law firm Withers, said the judgment was "a victory for the equal treatments of religions in the modern world".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "It always felt wrong that Louisa was denied the simple right, afforded to members of other religions, to enjoy a legal marriage ceremony in her own church."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling overturns a reading of the law from a 1970 court of appeal case, Segerdal, which upheld the refusal of the registrar general to register the Church of Scientology chapel in East Grinstead as a place of meeting for religious worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that 1970s ruling, the judge, Lord Denning, said he did not find reverence or veneration of God or a supreme being in the creed of the church of Scientology, adding "there may be a belief in a spirit of man, but there is no belief in a spirit of God".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lord Toulson, in a written judgment on the latest case, heard by the supreme court in July and agreed by three other judges, suggested religion should not be confined to beliefs that recognised a supreme deity. Such a position would otherwise exclude Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, Theosophy and part of Hinduism; and Jains, Thesophists and Buddhists, among others, had got registered places of worship in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court had heard evidence that Scientologists did believe in a supreme being of a kind "but of an abstract and impersonal nature", said Toulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideas about the nature of god were "the stuff of theological debate", he said, but neither the registrar general nor the courts should become drawn into such territory when deciding whether premises qualified as a place of meeting for religious worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toulson said: "I would describe religion in summary as a spiritual or non-secular belief system, held by a group of adherents, which claims to explain mankind's place in the universe and relationship with the infinite, and to teach its adherents how they are to live their lives in conformity with the spiritual understanding associated with the belief system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By spiritual or non-secular I mean a belief system which goes beyond that which can be perceived by the senses or ascertained by the application of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such a belief system may or may not involve belief in a supreme being, but it does involve a belief that there is more to be understood about mankind's nature and relationship to the universe than can be gained from the senses or from science. I emphasise that this is intended to be a description and not a definitive formula."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said of the approach he had taken with regard to the meaning of religion that the evidence was "amply sufficient to show that Scientology is within it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government signalled that the judgment could fuel a political row now there was the prospect of the Church of Scientology avoiding business rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local government minister, Brandon Lewis, said his department would be taking legal advice. Lewis said: "I am very concerned about this ruling, and its implication for business rates. In the face of concerns raised by Conservatives in opposition, Labour ministers told parliament during the passage of the equalities bill that Scientology would continue to fall outside the religious exemption for business rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we discover Scientology may be eligible for rate relief and that the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill, all thanks to Harriet Harman and Labour's flawed laws. Hard-pressed taxpayers will wonder why Scientology premises should now be given tax cuts when local firms have to pay their fair share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/uk-supreme-court"&gt;UK supreme court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/buddhism"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hinduism"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

After a series of technical problems, Watchkeeper finally received its "statement of type design assurance" in October from the Military Aviation Authority, giving the MoD the green light for airworthiness and safety tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture, UAV Tactical Systems, will oversee the Watchkeeper programme with work subcontracted to a number of other British companies. The design and technology of Watchkeeper is based on Elbit's Hermes 450 model, which Israel has used extensively over Gaza. British forces have used unarmed Hermes drones in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.waronwant.org/attachments/Killer%20Drones,%20War%20on%20Want.pdf" title=""&gt;23-page report (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday, War on Want refers to reports of armed Israeli UAVs killing Palestinians in Gaza. About 800 Palestinians have been reported killed in Israeli raids by drones between 2006 and 2011, the charity claims, citing the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. However, it is not known whether the strikes were by Elbit drones or by other Israeli unmanned weapons systems or aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;War on Want's senior campaigns officer Rafeef Ziadah said: "By supporting the arms trade with Israeli companies, the British government is sending a clear message of approval for Israel's aggression against the Palestinian people. The European Union is sending a similar message through its research funding for Israeli arms companies. It is high time both the UK and the EU ended their support for Israel's violations of international law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charity's report also says the previous Labour government rejected Israeli assurances that UK arms would not be deployed against civilians in Palestinian territory, but there were now 381 extant British arms licences to Israel, worth £7.8bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A MoD spokesperson told the Guardian: "Watchkeeper is an unarmed, remotely piloted air system that will provide ground troops with vital surveillance, reconnaissance and intelligence that will help save military and civilian lives. There is no intention to arm Watchkeeper, which like all the UK's unmanned air systems will be operated by highly trained pilots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elbit Systems said it had no comment to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/uk-government-warns-over-business-israeli-settlements" title=""&gt;the Guardian reported&lt;/a&gt; that new guidance published by UK Trade and Investment, which promotes British businesses in foreign markets, stated there were "clear risks" related to economic and financial activities in West Bank settlements, and it did not encourage or offer support to such activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance said: "Financial transactions, investments, purchases, procurements as well as other economic activities (including in services like tourism) in Israeli settlements or benefiting Israeli settlements, entail legal and economic risks stemming from the fact that the Israeli settlements, according to international law, are built on occupied land and are not recognised as a legitimate part of Israel's territory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziadah, who is on the national committee of the Palestinian boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, seized on the guidance, saying: "The UK government has realised that its condemnations of illegal settlements are falling on deaf ears, and has started to address the huge amount of economic support that the illegal settlements receive from UK businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/defence"&gt;Defence policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/drones"&gt;Drones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories"&gt;Palestinian territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardnortontaylor"&gt;Richard Norton-Taylor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
