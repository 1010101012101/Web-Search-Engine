<h3>Changes at Power Reporting</h3>

<P>The links are no longer being updated at Power Reporting, which for 12 years has been a free resource for journalists, while trying to help journalists integrate public records and Web research with daily and enterprise reporting.</p>

<P> Thanks to everyone who contributed time and suggestions through the years.</p>

<P>If a university journalism program or nonprofit association is interested in using this domain as an aid to journalists or journalism, drop me a line. Contact <A HREF="http://www.powerreporting.com/contact.html">Bill Dedman</A>. I don't think whoever takes over the site has to make it what it was. The name is flexible enough that it could be used for public records, crowdsourcing, computer-assisted reporting, etc.</P>

<P>Newsroom training is still being offered by Power Reporting in computer-assisted reporting, public records, writing and editing. <A HREF="http://powerreporting.com/seminars">Schedule a session for your newsroom</A>.</P>
