<h2>Korean media  monitoring &amp; analysis</h2>
<p>WiseBrief monitors and analyzes thousands of stories every day from <strong>Korean-language </strong>newspapers, magazines, news wire, and Web sources, providing English abstracts containing only the key facts customized to your needs.</p>
<p><strong>We solve the problems associated with traditional clipping services</strong> and its flaws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>information overload due to key-word based searches yielding redundant and low-level hits</li>
  <li>per-clip charges can add up and redundant clips offer no value</li>
  <li>translation requirements and fees can really add up</li>
  <li>difficult to  budget with  unforeseen per-clip charges and translation fees</li>
  <li>complicated copyright issues</li>
  </ul>
<p>We provide concise, human-edited English summaries of information from Korean media sources that would be difficult and time-consuming for you to obtain on your own and deliver them to you on a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis with real-time alerts.</p>
<p>Please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us for a <strong>free customized sample report</strong>. </p>
<h2>Competitive intelligence research</h2>

<p>WiseBrief has primary and secondary research and analysis capabilities and can  provide you with answers to specific questions regarding your competition in Korea and their activities domestic and abroad. </p>
<p>Our open source intelligence (OSINT) collection and analysis methods have been refined and adapted for the Korean environment based on 10 years of experience. This simply means we know where and how to get the information we need in the most efficient manner possible.</p>
<p>We use data visualization and link analysis techniques to produce <strong>actionable intelligence</strong> from seemingly disparate pieces of data and information.</p>
