			<p><em>Created by a student developer, Slader’s app empowers students around the world to help each other </em></p>
<p>New York, NY – December 10, 2013 – Slader just launched their new free mobile app to help high school and college students solve their homework problems. Slader’s app is available on the App Store and also the Slader website: <a href="http://www.slader.com/app">www.slader.com/app</a>. Thousands of students who have downloaded the new mobile app are extremely positive in their reviews.</p>
<p>For example, a Slader user who goes by Imtoolazytodohomework said in their review of Slader on the Apple Store: “I first found their website because I needed help with math homework. When I found it, I thought it was a lifesaver and now there is an app for it! Great quality and very helpful. You must download this!”</p>
<p>Slader is the online platform and network for homework help for students by students, and to date has helped over 5 million high school and early college students in more than 200 countries. Slader believes in empowering students to take charge of their own educational experience and so far has given students the insights to solve more than two million problems from 90 percent of the top high school textbooks.</p>
<p>Slader gives students free step-by-step explanations to homework problems and helps them to connect with other students around the world to figure out these problems. Unlike any other homework help site, all of the homework answers on Slader are provided by students themselves and don’t require students to solve problems not related to homework assignments. On both Slader’s site and mobile app, students can browse textbooks to find those assigned to classes they are taking; view solutions to problems in their books; comment on solutions to provide explanation to other students; and rate solutions based on their accuracy. Slader also has a built-in reward system where students can make money for contributing their input to the homework problems on the site.</p>
<p>Slader’s Mobile App Features and Benefits<br />
Slader’s new mobile app includes several features that help students complete their homework, connect directly with other students to solve problems and make money – all from their smartphones.</p>
<p>•Make money on Slader: Students can earn Slader “Gold,” a virtual currency that students offer to peers as a reward for solving specific homework problems and can be exchanged for real currency.<br />
•Solve real homework problems: Through the mobile app, if a student wants a homework problem solved, they can offer Gold, take a picture of their problem and post it to Slader for another student to solve. Students can also take a picture of the homework answer they’ve solved, upload it to Slader.com and they’re then rewarded with Gold.<br />
•Interact directly with peers: Regardless of geographic location, students can browse through textbooks and exchange explanations and answers with each other.</p>
<p>The Wiz Kid Who Developed Slader’s App<br />
Slader’s new app functionality was built by a student app developer, Sam Giddins, while he was a senior at Scarsdale Senior High School in Scarsdale, NY. Giddins was searching for an internship when he realized that Slader, a website he and his peers used prolifically, was also based in New York City. Throughout the development process, Giddins guided direction of app development towards the mindset of a high schoolers and how the student demographic wants to interact with Slader.</p>
<p>Slader’s co-founders, Kyle Gerrity and Scott Kolb, met while they were in high school and came up with the idea for founding Slader as a result of their own experiences struggling with homework.</p>
<p>“Homework is too often used as a take-home test where students find themselves struggling in isolation. Slader breaks down that barrier and allows students to leverage their peers for help and be members of an academic community,” said Kyle Gerrity, co-founder of Slader.</p>
<p>“With the right tools and positive reinforcement, most students welcome the opportunity to master concepts,” said Scott Kolb, co-founder of Slader. “We designed our mobile app to help students learn and succeed quickly and easily. After they download the app, all students have to do is turn to their phone to access the same rich information that’s available on the web. Slader is a natural extension of the social environment that students are already interacting with via web and mobile.”</p>
<p>About Slader<br />
Slader is for students, by students. The company’s mission is to help students learn, connect and succeed by providing an online platform and student network for homework collaboration. Unlike other academic platforms, Slader offers content that is entirely user-generated, free and built for the social environment that students already rely on to connect with each other. Slader has helped millions of students in 200+ countries overcome frustration with their nightly homework, and has empowered student contributors to solve more than 2 million problems from 90 percent of the top high school textbooks. Slader’s vision is to provide every student with open access to the academic resources that empower their success. Founded in 2010 by Kyle Gerrity and Scott Kolb, Slader is a privately funded company, based in New York City. <a href="http://www.slader.com">www.slader.com</a></p>

			<p><em>Five expert business and legal insights help college students form and finance businesses</em></p>
<p>MENLO PARK, CA – Founders Workbench, a <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com">free online legal</a> and business resource for entrepreneurs from leading national law firm <a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/">Goodwin Procter</a>, today released the Founders Workbench High Five for Startups. The checklist provides essential tips to help college entrepreneurs navigate the legal and organizational challenges of starting and running a business.</p>
<p>“Undergraduate entrepreneurship is on the rise, but undergraduate students often don’t have the same access to capital and advisory resources as career entrepreneurs,” said <a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/People/V/Van-Horne-David.aspx">David Van Horne</a>, Goodwin Procter partner and Founders Workbench contributor. “We created the High Five for Startups to help student entrepreneurs save time and money, and overcome some of the initial challenges often faced by first time founders.”</p>
<p>Founders Workbench High Five for Startups</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/forming-your-start-up-hold/">Choose the Appropriate Legal Structure</a> – Corporation or LLC? One of the first and most important steps in creating a company is choosing a legal structure that best suits the long-term needs of the business and its owners.</p>
<p>2) Use Trusted Legal Documents – While they may appear to save time and money, random legal documents found on the Internet may not be accurate, complete or appropriate. Identify a trusted <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/document-driver/">source for legal documents</a> when starting a business.</p>
<p>3) Protect Your Intellectual Property – With this year’s <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/last-chance-for-first-to-invent-patent-protection-rapidly-approaches/">changes to the intellectual property laws</a>, entrepreneurs need to move faster than ever to protect their key intellectual property. When launching a business, founders should research <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/protecting/">common intellectual property problems</a>, patents and trade secrets, and trademarks.</p>
<p>4) Understand Financing Options – This year’s <a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/JOBS-Act.aspx">dramatic additions to crowdfunding laws</a> have created new options for financing a business. Before rushing into a Kickstarter campaign or deciding to pursue angel funding, take the time to understand the <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/financing-strategies/">startup financing options</a> available.</p>
<p>5) Brush Up on Startup Jargon – Even before you start a business, it’s never too soon to research and absorb the key terms and jargon regularly used by investors and legal counsel. <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/deal-dictionary/">Founders Workbench Deal Dictionary</a> app is an ideal primer on key deal terminology.</p>
<p>About Founders Workbench</p>
<p>Founders Workbench is a free online resource that helps entrepreneurs navigate the legal and organizational challenges faced by startups and emerging companies. Originally launched in 2010 with free legal documents for <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/document-driver/">C-Corporation formation</a>, the site has been redesigned and enhanced with Document Driver, a comprehensive set of legal documents for <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/document-driver/">establishing Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)</a>, and two new web apps: Capital Calculator, which allows founders to instantly <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/capital-calculator/">calculate dilution and liquidity</a> under different financing and exit scenarios, and Deal Dictionary, which introduces founders to the often obscure <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/deal-dictionary/">legal and financial terms</a> used by venture capitalists and angel investors.

			<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p><em></em><em>Museum to Offer College Credit and Summer Study Abroad in New Orleans and France</em></p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS (December 2, 2013) –The National WWII Museum, in partnership with Nicholls State University, is offering high school and college students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on leadership and decision-making skills based on those exhibited by the great leaders of WWII.</p>
<p>Normandy Academy is a unique summer study abroad program that challenges students with the same impactful decisions as generals, officers and soldiers during the historic D-Day invasions. The ten-day, leadership-themed program starts in the exhibits, archives and warehouses of The National WWII Museum in New Orleans and ends in the historic American Cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach, Normandy. In between, students will visit battle sites, interact with French citizens and tour monuments and museums.</p>
<p>&#8220;This summer marks the 70th anniversary of D-Day, and the men who fought in Normandy are leaving us,&#8221; said National WWII Museum Senior Director of History and Research, Dr. Keith Huxen. “For students interested in history, this is an opportunity of a lifetime and never to be repeated.”</p>
<p>The National WWII Museum also offers students a summer learning experience in New Orleans. The Student Leadership Academy &#8211; Summer Residential Program takes students through the history of WWII with the aim of exploring leadership lessons from one of the most important periods in world history. This six-night, seven-day program immerses students in the Museum’s wealth of exhibits, artifacts, images and documents with structured Leadership Lesson Debates along the way. Students will experience what it was like to be a member of a five-man crew inside a Sherman Tank, inspect the flight logs of a bomber pilot and handle the gear of an infantryman in WWII.</p>
<p>Not only will students have the unique opportunity to study WWII history at one of the world’s top-rated museums and meet some of the men and women who experienced the war firsthand, they will also venture out to historic sites in the community, including the Chalmette National Battlefield and NASA Michoud Assembly Facility, the former site of the plant that produced the Higgins Boats used in the war.</p>
<p>Upon completion of these programs, students will leave with a deeper understanding of US history and knowledge of the skills exhibited by some of our nation’s most distinguished leaders.</p>
<p>Students who participate in Normandy Academy and Student Leadership Academy are eligible to receive three credit hours after a rigorous online course administered by the Museum and the history department of Nicholls State University, an accredited regional university located in Thibodaux, Louisiana. For more information, call (877) 813-3329 x 514 or visit <a href="http://www.ww2museumtours.org">www.ww2museumtours.org</a>.</p>
<p><b>The National WWII Museum</b> tells the story of the American experience in the <i>war that changed the world </i>– why it was fought, how it was won, and what it means today.  Founded in 2000, the Museum  celebrates the courage and sacrifice of the men and women who served on the battlefront and the Home Front.

			<p><em>Avon’s Digital-First Imprint Encourages Graduate and Undergraduate Writing Students to Submit Romance Manuscripts for Chance to Win One-on-One Editorial Consultation.</em><br />
<em>All Submissions will be Considered for Publication by Avon Impulse!</em></p>
<p>NEW YORK, NY, November 21, 2013 –September marks the end of summer and a return to academia—and for many university students, it’s also a return the equally grueling and rewarding routine of creative writing classes. Avon Books and Avon Impulse, imprints of HarperCollins Publishers, recognizes the raw talent and passion for the craft that many students bring to their work, and it is for this reason that they have chosen to work with HarperCollins’ Academic Marketing division to launch an initiative seeking emerging young stars of Romance.</p>
<p>Graduate and undergraduate students are invited to submit up to three chapters (or 50 pages), a detailed synopsis (no more than five pages) of the romance novel. Entrants should also include a brief paragraph on what their follow-up book would be to the Avon Impulse Editors. For more information and contest guidelines, <a title="Go to http://collegewriters.avonromance.com." href="http://collegewriters.avonromance.com.">http://collegewriters.avonromance.com</a>.</p>
<p>What are Avon’s editors looking for? Amanda Bergeron, the lead editor for the Avon Impulse digital-first publishing imprint, says, “First and foremost, we always want a fresh voice and an ability to create real-to-life characters. Beyond that, we are looking for writers who have an understanding of what’s working in the current market. And if you can make us laugh, cry, or go absolutely weak-kneed, that certainly doesn’t hurt. Know your strengths when you write – and trust in a great editor to make your manuscript even stronger!”</p>
<p>Avon is actively acquiring the following types of novels:<br />
• New Adult romance<br />
• Romantic suspense<br />
• Super sexy contemporaries<br />
• Trilogies &#8212; and beyond.<br />
• Serialized erotic romance</p>
<p>What types of submissions will get students noticed? Bergeron notes, “Fabulously sexy heroes who let nothing get in the way of getting what they want – the heroine of course – and giving her everything she needs,” are top-of-bell curve for Avon editorial. Emphasis is also on heroines who are unafraid to take chances in life&#8230; and in love. “World-building” is key – writers are asked to choose the setting, just make sure it&#8217;s utterly romantic! Readers should be able to immerse themselves in the wonderful world that an author creates. &#8220;Series Wanted!&#8221; Bergeron asserts that readers always cry out for more when authors give them characters to believe in &#8230; so, in outlines, aspiring authors are asked to give Avon’s editors an idea of more stories to come in the same vein. And finally – for anyone who has discovered the super-dramatic, addictive joy of New Adult, editors are looking for dark spectacles that e xplore the many twists and turns of true love.</p>
<p>Contest guidelines can be found at <a title="Go to http://collegewriters.avonromance.com--but" href="http://collegewriters.avonromance.com--but">http://collegewriters.avonromance.com</a>. But, sky’s the limit, since there are no specific call outs for this opportunity; as long as it’s romance, it qualifies! This call for submissions is aimed directly at students.</p>
<p>Deadlines:<br />
All submissions should be digitally sent by 5 pm on April 1, 2014, via email to <a href="mailto:avonromancecollege@gmail.com">avonromancecollege@gmail.com</a>. All submissions must be submitted from a college email address. All submissions will be reviewed and considered for publication through Avon Impulse, the publisher’s digital-first arm—winners will be announced on May 15, 2014.</p>

			<p>Today, NARAL Pro-Choice America announced the winners of the “Choice Out Loud” short story contest. The contest asked young people between the ages of 18 and 30 to write a story that reflected the complexity of unplanned pregnancies in America today. Approximately 300 stories were submitted from across the country.</p>
<p>“I would like to thank all of the contest participants who took the time to write thoughtful and creative stories about choice,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. “We were overwhelmed by the power and the depth of these stories submitted by young people from across the country. The number of stories submitted for our first national essay contest exceed our expectations. This has been a wonderful opportunity to provide a new platform to talk about the complex situations of individuals facing an unintended pregnancy. We look forward to replicating its success in the future. ”</p>
<p>The winners of the contest were:</p>
<p>-Grand Prize awarded to Morgan M., whose story walks through a woman’s internal thought process as she decides to have an abortion.<br />
-First Place Prize awarded to Madeline G., whose story revisits a candid discussion about abortion between mother and daughter.<br />
-People’s Choice Prize awarded to Kai N., whose story features a transgender man’s experience with an unplanned pregnancy.</p>

			<p>November 19, 2013 – SetMeUp, a social discovery app, announces that in its initial release it achieved over 3 million searchable profiles. Unlike hook-up apps like Tinder where you’re connecting to complete strangers, with SetMeUp you find dates through friend introductions. The app utilizes friend-of-friend connections to help individuals meet new singles and enrich their first date experiences.</p>
<p>SetMeUp creates an ecosystem where people can meet as they normally would offline, through their mutual friends. By leveraging Facebook, which people already trust and feel comfortable using, SetMeUp enables people to find and easily connect with their friends of friends. Users are able to connect to people who they are more likely to trust because everyone falls within the same social circles.</p>
<p>This is particularly appealing to the college market since they can avoid the stigma of telling their friends they met someone online. The application is designed so no one knows who is using the app other than those people successfully connecting with each other, maintaining full privacy for the user. College students and post-college graduates simply install the app on Facebook, select friends, and then search through those friend’s friends sorted by compatibility.</p>
<p>“The goal is to get away from traditional online dating models and use social platforms that are integral to our everyday lives,” says SetMeUp co-founder and Harvard Business School grad, Abhishek Jain. In addition to launching the app, SetMeUp is also excited to announce the creation of an internship program for college students interested in entrepreneurship and marketing. “Launching any product, especially one as innovative as SetMeUp, is an amazing learning experience for everyone involved,” says Jain. Students interested in applying for this internship opportunity can e-mail their resume to <a href="mailto:apply@setmeupinc.com">apply@setmeupinc.com</a>.</p>
<p>College students at the University of Georgia love the application. Morgan Leaf, an undergraduate student at UGA, is tired of using hook-up apps where guys are sleazy. &#8220;I like SetMeUp because guys realize they&#8217;re accountable to our mutual friends.&#8221; says Leaf. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t date any other way.&#8221; A senior at Boston University, Estela Del Mar, feels the same way, adding, &#8220;On other dating apps, you don&#8217;t get any quality connections. With SetMeUp, I get connected through my friends so I can trust the people I meet.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>About SetMeUp</strong><br />
SetMeUp is a social discovery application, available on web and mobile devices, that helps you meet a new romantic interest through mutual friends on Facebook. To get a better understanding of the product, you can access SetMeUp on your web browser at <a href="http://www.setmeupapp.com">www.setmeupapp.com</a>. Mobile is expected to be released within the month.</p>

			<p>Phil Southerland, global diabetes advocate and founder of the world’s first all-diabetes professional cycling team, is launching the Team Type 1 Foundation today, on World Diabetes Day. Pursuing a mission of education, empowerment and global access to medicine for everyone affected by diabetes, the Foundation will address disparities in diabetes care around the world through collaborative strategies that engage governments, health organizations, healthcare providers, diabetes educators and people with diabetes.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s first U.S. initiative is a scholarship program for collegiate athletes with type 1 diabetes who compete in an NCAA sport. In 2014, the program will award up to seven scholarships of $5,000 each to help student athletes and their families offset the cost of diabetes care, which can average an additional $300-$500 per month. Scholarship recipients will also be integrated into the Foundation’s educational platform as future diabetes ambassadors.</p>
<p>“The Team Type 1 Foundation exists because everyone with diabetes deserves the right to lead a healthy and productive life,” said Southerland. “In developing countries, that means changing healthcare policy to ensure everyone has access to the medicine and tools they need to survive and thrive. In the U.S it means providing empowerment and inspiration to people with diabetes while also supporting student athletes who absorb the added financial burden of managing diabetes while going through college. Sport is an incredible platform for inspiration and we are very excited to help young athletes pursue their dreams.”</p>
<p>Southerland is the Foundation’s President and Founder, while Dr. Biljana Southerland will serve as Program Director of Medical and Governmental Affairs. Dr. Southerland is a former advisor to the Macedonian Ministry of Health and the architect of Macedonia’s National Diabetes Program, one of the most progressive diabetes care policies in the world.</p>
<p>“More than 371 million people worldwide have diabetes and many are needlessly suffering from preventable complications or even death, simply because they do not have access to the medication or tools necessary to manage their condition,” said Dr. Southerland. “The Team Type 1 Foundation is dedicated to changing these statistics.”</p>
<p>Based in part on the success of the Macedonian program &#8212; which fully covers the cost of insulin and glucose testing supplies for everyone in the country living with diabetes &#8212; the Team Type 1 Foundation will largely focus on helping developing countries around the world scale the Macedonian model to establish sustainable diabetes care policy.</p>
<p>Starting in Rwanda, a country where seven out of eight people with diabetes die before they are even diagnosed, the Foundation is working with government and healthcare officials to build a long-term solution. This year, the Foundation is donating 1 million test strips and 900 blood glucose monitors, effectively providing a one-year supply for the entire Rwandan population of individuals with type 1 diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>About Team Type 1 Foundation</strong><br />
The Team Type 1 Foundation is a nonprofit organization pursuing a mission of education, empowerment and equal access to medicine for everyone affected by diabetes. Collaborating with governments, healthcare professionals, diabetes experts and individuals living with diabetes around the world, the Team Type 1 Foundation is bridging the gap to access and education through sustainable and economically viable solutions.

			<p><em>Campus Special joins in the fight against hunger by offering a “round-up to the nearest dollar” initiative on food delivery.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Atlanta, GA November 13, 2013 &#8211; Campus Special is excited to introduce its new partnership with WhyHunger, a <a title="leading" href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=6004#.UltA2xbNdUR" rel="nofollow">leading</a> charitable organization dedicated to ending hunger in the U.S. and around the world and recognized for excellence in fiscal management, accountability, and transparency. Beginning this week, when an order for take-out or delivery is placed at <a title="campusspecial.com" href="http://www.campusspecial.com/" rel="nofollow">CampusSpecial.com</a> or on the <a title="Campus Special app" href="http://www.campusspecial.com/app?q=MAPRELEASE" rel="nofollow">Campus Special app</a>, there will be an opportunity to round-up to the nearest dollar at checkout. One hundred percent of all donations will go to <a title="whyhunger.org" href="http://www.whyhunger.org/" rel="nofollow">WhyHunger</a>, a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to connecting families in need with nutritious meals and supporting grassroots organizations working to end hunger and poverty.“Working with WhyHunger is a great fit for Campus Special,” said CEO Chau Nguyen.</p>
<p>“College students live on tight budgets and they appreciate the value of every dollar, quarter, dime, and nickel. They also want to make a difference in their communities. Contributing their change by rounding up to the next dollar on each food order changes the lives of families who struggle on a regular basis to provide enough food for their children and for themselves. It’s a true pay-it-forward opportunity.”</p>
<p>Campus Special Director of Online Sales &amp; Business Development, Stephanie Scott, says college students understand the significance of the campaign message &#8220;We feed you. You feed the hungry.&#8221; She says it is a particularly powerful one as the holidays approach. “This opportunity to make small donations as individuals that add up to effecting significant change as a group epitomizes the spirit of giving during the holidays,” said Scott.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Campus Special provides an easy way for college students eager to make a difference in their own communities and beyond to join us in the movement to ensure everyone has access to nutritious food,” said Bill Ayres, WhyHunger co-founder and executive director. “By investing in grassroots organizations and local solutions to hunger and poverty, WhyHunger is able to amplify these round-up donations to have a sustainable impact in communities across the country and around the world.”</p>
<p>With one out of ten families in the U.S. going without enough to eat on a regular basis and 923 million people around the globe struggling to feed themselves and their families, hunger is a urgent need in our world. WhyHunger is leading a movement to end hunger by connecting families in need to nutritious food and combating the root causes of hunger by working in communities across the country to change systems, build local power and invest in long-term solutions.</p>
<p>Nguyen explained that careful consideration was given to choosing the right charitable organization. “Campus Special is dedicated to helping college kids do more for less. We wanted to extend that philosophy in a meaningful way across all the communities we serve. And we wanted to involve those same students in the process, allowing them to participate in improving the lives of those around them. We are truly honored to work with an organization like WhyHunger that has been <a title="recognized" href="http://www.whyhunger.org/getinfo/showArticle/articleId/3101" rel="nofollow">recognized</a> for the honesty and effectiveness of its work to combat hunger and poverty in our world,” said Nguyen.</p>

			<p>New Sports Entertainment Network Brings Exclusive NFL Team Video Content to Desktops, Tablets, Smart TVs and Game Consoles for Free</p>
<p>Los Angeles, CA – November 12, 2013 – DeskSite, a free-to-use digital video entertainment network, today announced the official launch of an innovative new app, which is revolutionizing the way college NFL fans can consume online video content.</p>
<p>Richer, faster, and more personalized than websites, these new Big Screen apps &#8212; called “DeskSites” &#8212; enable instantaneous video playback without any of the buffering, freezing, and frame-dropping associated with web-based video streaming. Essentially a free DVR for the Internet, NFL fans can instantly rewind, fast-forward, and play back video in slow-motion – even when they’re offline.</p>
<p>Instead of smartphones, these special apps have been specifically designed for desktops, laptops, tablets, game consoles, and smart TV’s, and are customized for individual NFL teams. Always free to the end-user, additional features range from audiovisual alerts to viewer content curation control.</p>
<p>Each participating NFL team provides between 25 to 40 hours per month of HD video, much of which is either chronologically or platform exclusive. Current content partners include the reigning Super Bowl Champion Baltimore Ravens, Houston Texans, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, New York Giants, New York Jets, Oakland Raiders, St. Louis Rams, and Washington Redskins and Chicago Bears, with more to follow as the season progresses.</p>
<p>“The Jets DeskSite offers fans an entertainment experience unrivaled in the digital space,” said Jeff Fernandez, VP Business Development &amp; Ventures at the New York Jets.</p>
<p>Patriots Publisher and VP of Content, Fred Kirsch, commented, “There’s no question this new technology has earned its place at the digital table and is here to stay.”</p>
<p>“These new Big Screen apps represent a well-balanced combination of great new technology with Must See Video. If you’re an NFL fan, you’re going to want your team’s DeskSite,” said Richard Gillam, DeskSite CEO. Delighted to partner with so many NFL teams, he explains, “There is no entertainment content more monetizable than high-def video from America&#8217;s most valuable sports teams, and with our unique ability to target video ads by age &amp; gender, we intend to push the envelope even further.”</p>
<p>To download a DeskSite from one of the aforementioned teams, simply visit their website and look under the “Media” section. For more information about the company, visit <a href="http://www.DeskSite.com">www.DeskSite.com</a></p>
