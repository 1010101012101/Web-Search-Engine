<p>Holidays can be a mixed bag. It&#8217;s not always Norman Rockwell perfect. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t re-create them into something that is sane and celebratory. Here&#8217;s what the &#8220;experts&#8221; have to say.</p>
<blockquote><p>To many people holidays are not voyages of discovery, but a ritual of reassurance.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Phillip Adams</li>
</ul>
<p>The human race has not devised any way of dissolving barriers, getting to know the other chap fast, breaking the ice, that is one-tenth as handy and efficient as letting you and the other chap, or chaps, cease to be totally sober at about the same rate in agreeable surroundings.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Kingsley Amis</li>
</ul>
<p>Christmas is a holiday that persecutes the lonely, the frayed and the rejected.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Jimmy Cannon</li>
</ul>
<p>Christmas is a season not only of rejoicing but of reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Winston Churchill</li>
</ul>
<p>If Christmas is for families, what do you do when there are families scattered all over the country? I am pretty sure God wants to make sure I touch all the bases, even if I spend his actual birthday with Delta Airlines.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Gail Collins</li>
</ul>
<p>The gist of New Year’s Day is: Try again.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Frank Crane</li>
</ul>
<p>What I don’t like about office Christmas parties is looking for a job the next day.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Phyllis Diller</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for excess decoration, excess commercialism, excess editorializing, excess caroling, excess bibbling, and excess cheer, I heartily approve of the Christmas spirit.</p>
<ul>&#8211;William Feather</ul>
<p>Christmas is a tonic for our souls. It moves us to think of others rather than of ourselves. It directs our thoughts to giving.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;B.C. Forbes</li>
</ul>
<p>People are happier at Yuletime because they take the milk of human kindness out of the deep freeze.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Arnold Glasow</li>
</ul>
<p>I never believed in Santa Claus because I knew no white dude would come into my neighborhood after dark.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211;Dick Gregory</li>
</ul>

<p>This story reminds us that even the youngest of us can make a change. Or at the very least, experience the process of <em>trying</em> to make a change!</p>
<blockquote><p>A 6-year-old boy who dreams of being an astronaut for NASA has taken matters into his own hands by starting an online petition to try and save NASA.</p>
<p>Connor Johnson has wanted to be an astronaut since he was three. When he learned that congress was threatening his future prospects to be a scientist or astronaut with NASA by cutting NASA&#8217;s funding, he decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My whole idea was writing off to the President and then I decided to give my whole piggy bank to NASA. I have about $10.41,&#8221; Conner explained.</p>
<p>However, after talking to his family members about the issue, Conner decided he needed to find a more effective way to reach NASA.</p>
<p>His family helped him start a petition. Although he did have some guidance, Conner constructed the petition ideas on his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get a response from the White House, I need 100,000 signatures,&#8221; Conner said.</p>
<p>As of Saturday evening, he has more than 300 signatures. While it may be a big challenge to get to 100,000, Connor said he thinks it&#8217;s possible because NASA has shown him that any mission can be accomplished with small steps.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s rare that an organ donor&#8217;s relatives meet the recipients, since there a privacy laws in place. But the mother of a deceased son and one lucky woman have the chance to meet.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>A young woman has been given the opportunity to meet the mother of the man who, through his death, saved her life.</span></p>
<p><span>Lyndsey McLaughlin, 28, met Diana Rodriguez whose 18-year-old son’s lungs she was given during life-saving transplant surgery.</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, organ donors legally have to remain anonymous but the two New York women were so keen to meet that they made it happen.</span></p>

<p>You&#8217;re doing, they&#8217;re doing, everybody&#8217;s doing it. But do we notice it? Do we use it to steady our mind and lift our souls? Here&#8217;s some sage words regarding a perfectly ordinary process:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: georgia,bookman old style,palatino linotype,book antiqua,palatino,trebuchet ms,helvetica,garamond,sans-serif,arial,verdana,avante garde,century gothic,comic sans ms,times,times new roman,serif">When you own your breath, nobody can steal your peace.  ~Author Unknown</span></p>
<p>What we call &#8216;I&#8217; is just a swinging door, which moves when we inhale and when we exhale. ~Shunryu Suzuki</p>
<p>A healthy mind has an easy breath.  ~Author Unknown</p>
<p>If you woke up breathing, congratulations!  You have another chance.  ~Andrea Boydston</p>
<p>Inhale, and God approaches you.  Hold the inhalation, and God remains with you.  Exhale, and you approach God.  Hold the exhalation, and surrender to God.  ~Krishnamacharya</p>
<p>Breathing is the greatest pleasure in life.  ~Giovanni Papini</p>
<p>Smile, breathe and go slowly.  ~Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
<p>Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor. ~Thích Nh?t H?nh</p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia,bookman old style,palatino linotype,book antiqua,palatino,trebuchet ms,helvetica,garamond,sans-serif,arial,verdana,avante garde,century gothic,comic sans ms,times,times new roman,serif">He lives most life whoever breathes most air.  ~Elizabeth Barrett Browning<br />
</span></p>

<p>Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.  ~L. Frank Baum</p>
<p>The practice is simply this: keep coming back to your breath during the day. Just take a moment. This will give your mind a steadiness and your breath a gracefulness&#8230;. There&#8217;s so much to let go of, isn&#8217;t there? Your nostalgia and your regrets. Your fantasies and your fears. What you think you <i>want</i> instead of what is happening right now. <i>Breathe.</i> ~Rodney Yee, <i>Yoga: The Poetry of the Body</i></p>

		<p>Want an experiment to easily lift your spirits? Try some fake laughter first thing in the morning. It may feel strange at first but eventually, it will feel comfortable and easy&#8230;we are laughing creatures afterall!</p>
<p>Why laugh?</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the psychological lift, it does our bodies a world of good. In a sense, laughing is like exercise—it boosts the immune system, aids digestion and improves cardiovascular and lung function. It’s also believed to raise levels of good cholesterol and reduce pain, inflammation, blood pressure and stress hormone levels. When we laugh, we release <em>endorphins</em>, chemicals that function as neurotransmitters and block pain receptors in the brain.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.bottomlinepublications.com/content/article/health-a-healing/even-a-fake-laugh-will-do">BottomLinePublications</a></p></blockquote>
<p>How to fake laugh?</p>
<blockquote><p>Immediately after waking up in the morning, look in the mirror and laugh. Begin with 10 or 20 seconds, and try to work your way up to two minutes, if you can. Again, feel free to fake it at first. That will get you going. This exercise gives you an energy boost…relieves stress…and helps you feel good all day long.</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Teresa Verde is a certified laughter leader and laughter yoga leader in Seattle, Washington <a href="http://www.OneThousandLaughs.com" target="_blank">www.OneThousandLaughs.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s that easy&#8230;and really, what do you have to lose? Make sure you take note of the sensation after you&#8217;ve laughed. You should notice relaxation, deeper breather and a sense of feeling lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>So get laughing and lighten your load!</strong></p>

From the air, fast down, and from the ground, fast up.<br />~ Jesse Owens</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I have a love/hate relationship with running. It&#8217;s an easily accessible sport, so it&#8217;s often the &#8220;go to&#8221; activity for many. Some people love running&#8230;and I&#8217;m not quite sure why. There must be something wonderful and amazing about it and I want in on it!</p>
<p>So here are some quotes from runners on training and racing to inspire the not-so-excited runners:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Training:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Some people train knowing they’re not working as hard as other people. I can’t fathom how they think.”</em> -Alberto Salazar</p>
<p><em> “Somewhere in the world someone is training when you are not. When you race him, he will win.”</em> – Tom Fleming’s Boston Marathon training sign on his wall</p>
<p><em>“Today I will run what you will not so that tomorrow I will run what you cannot.”</em> – author unknown</p>
<p><em>“The will to win means nothing if you haven’t the will to prepare.”</em> – Juma Ikangaa, 1989 NYC Marathon winner</p>
<p><em>“Every morning in Africa a gazelle wakes up. It knows it must move faster than the lion or it will not survive. Every morning a lion wakes up and it knows it must move faster than the slowest gazelle or it will starve. It doesn’t matter if you are the lion or the gazelle, when the sun comes up, you better be moving.”</em> – Maurice Greene (attributed to Roger Bannister shortly after running the first sub-4 mile)</p>
<p><em>“Running is a big question mark that’s there each and every day. It asks you, ‘Are you going to be a wimp or are you going to be strong today?’”</em> – Peter Maher, Irish-Canadian Olympian and Sub-2:12 marathoner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Racing:</strong></p>
<p><em>“The gun goes off and everything changes… the world changes… and nothing else really matters.” - Patti Sue Plummer</em></p>
<p><em> “Most people run a race to see who is fastest. I run a race to see who has the most guts.”</em> -Steve Prefontaine</p>
<p><em>“To move into the lead means making an act requiring fierceness and confidence. But fear must play some part…no relaxation is possible, and all discretion is thrown into the wind.”</em> -Roger Bannister</p>
<p><em>“A champion is afraid of losing. Everyone else is afraid of winning.” </em>-Billie Jean King (tennis player)</p>
<p><em>“I tell our runners to divide the race into thirds. Run the first part with your head, the middle part with your personality, and the last part with your heart.”</em> – Mike Fanelli</p>
<p><em>“If you can’t win, make the fellow ahead of you break the record.” </em><em>– Unknown</em></p>

<p>We often don&#8217;t think in terms of basic comforts that many soldiers don&#8217;t have access to when in combat. But Sarah Damelio did. Read her story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aesthetician Sara Damelio originally developed Skincando <a href="http://www.skincando.com/" target="_blank">Combat-Ready Balm </a>for civilians with major skin problems like rough, dry skin; irritation and redness; and acne that scars. But when a soldier’s wife ordered some, and asked Damelio about shipping it to Iraq for the skin problems he was having, that made Damelio target the military. She quickly discovered that the salve was ammunition for soldiers fighting extreme sun exposure, sand-flea bites, and desert-dry skin.</p>
<p>She’s not capitalizing on the situation. A non-profit arm of Skincando called Operation Sand Flea allows you to purchase products at wholesale prices with free shipping to service people and troops.</p>

		<p>Sometimes life&#8217;s problems seem to be solely generated from between your ears. Of course, we may be experiencing actual issues, but our interpretation is really what defines it.</p>
<p>Well the next time you&#8217;re trying to understand why you seem to be in a funk or communications seem particularly poor or you find yourself thinking about the past too much, check out the stars and see what they have to say.</p>
<p>Listen, even if you don&#8217;t believe in all that &#8220;mumbo jumbo&#8221;, you can still benefit from astrologists who are very exacting and detailed in their approach when it comes to planetary influences and how they might be affecting you.</p>
<p><em>The important part?</em> Just stay open! Review what&#8217;s being said and look at your problems in context of something bigger than the confines of your busy brain.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, meet <a href="http://willowsweb.blogspot.com/">Willow&#8217;s Web Astrology</a>, written by a sharp and insightful writer and astrologer.</p>

		<p>What is it about the approaching winter that brings out such a primal side of us? Suddenly we want to hibernate and eat more, do less. This can often cause problems because life carries on in winter, but that inner caveman or woman secretly want to crawls under some animal furs and sleep! What do others have to say?</p>
