<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The Diageo Africa Business Reporting Awards recognise journalists and editors who provide high quality coverage of the business environment in Africa.</p>

<p>Since the Awards’ inception in 2004, Africa is a different place and is home to some of the world’s fastest growing economies. Against this backdrop, the Awards continue to seek out, recognise and reward excellence in business journalism. </p>

<p>This year, 2013, marks the ten-year anniversary of the Awards. Over the last decade, the strength and depth of reporting on business in Africa has increased significantly, and perceptions of Africa as an investment destination have changed for the better. Investors are taking Africa seriously and changing perceptions of Africa is an important step in improving the continent’s investment climate. </p>

<p>We want to recognise and reward those journalists and editors who are providing the best coverage of business in Africa. The Diageo Africa Business Reporting Awards  celebrate their achievements.  The Awards recognise the fact that more and better business journalism plays an important role in Africa’s investment flows. We believe that better and more accurate reporting generates more business interest on the continent.</p>
