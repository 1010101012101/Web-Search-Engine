<br><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:#808080">Patrick Louis Knudsen, The Heritage Foundation</span><br><span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">The collapse of congressional budgeting in recent years has occurred just as the government's fiscal outlook is approaching critical. If left unchecked, current trends will lead to unprecedented levels of federal spending as a share of US economic output, far beyond taxpayers' historical tolerance and perhaps greater than the economy can sustain. The resulting debt would seriously hamper the nation's potential for long-term growth. These trends can be corrected only with a regular, stable, and sustained practice of budgeting. As Congress continues to struggle with its current procedures, the prospects seem doubtful. Yet the breakdown of the budget process threatens more than severe fiscal and economic consequences. It enables an unrestrained expansion of the public sector, undermines orderly congressional policymaking, exacerbates public frustration, and cedes undue power to the executive branch. In short, the chronic failure of congressional budgeting erodes democratic procedures and the constitutional system itself.</span></td>

<span style="color:#808080">Frank Salvato</span><br><span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">With the 2013 Virginia Gubernatorial Election in the books, three things become apparent. First, the citizenry's aversion to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is alive and well. Second, when Conservatives run inferior campaigns or get duped into the Progressive trap of debating "social issues," it doesn't matter how rooted the message is in common sense and fact, Progressives and Liberals will always be able to manipulate enough voters to squeak out election victories. And third, Conservatives need to understand that a split from the Republican Party will doom them to second or even third party status for generations. To say that the voters of Virginia now have a governor with a shady political background would be an understatement. Even before Governor-Elect McAuliffe served as Democrat National Committee Chairman, his actions as a major rainmaker for then candidate and President Clinton, found him with his hands dirty from a number of questionable dealings.</span><br><br>

<span style="color:#808080">Frank Salvato</span><br><span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">October 22, 2013 - Just as the American people begin eying the torches and pitchforks, readying their maps of Washington, DC, the establishment politicos have set themselves to brazenly cover their butts yet again. This time, they are proposing a way to absolve themselves from tough votes on raising the debt ceiling. In the aftermath of our current President's disingenuous declaration that raising the debt ceiling "doesn't necessarily mean adding to the debt," and his infantile temper-tantrum about the government being held "hostage" because House Republicans wouldn't let him have the federal credit card for his "date with destiny," it isn't surprising that the usual suspects are floating a fiscally irresponsible, but politically advantageous, plan to avoid the ugliness of actually governing where the debt and debt ceiling are concerned.</span><br><br>

<span style="color:#808080">Victor Davis Hanson<br></span>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">In the past there have been all sorts of presidential fibbing. Some chief executives make promises that they know they probably cannot or will not keep. Before his reelection for his third term in the midst 450px-Revolving_Doorof a world war, Franklin Roosevelt swore that he would never send American boys to fight in a foreign war. In just a little over a year, he did just that. Lyndon Johnson likewise before the 1964 election said he would not send troops to Vietnam. But once reelected, he sent nearly 200,000 troops to fight the North Vietnamese; by the time he left office, over a half-million Americans were deployed in Vietnam. In 1988 presidential candidate George H. W. Bush pledged that he would not raise taxes and did so emphatically: "Read my lips -- no new taxes!" But in 1990 he flipped and agreed to tax hikes. Barack Obama has offered all sorts of similar empty pledges, like promising to close the federal detention center at Guantanamo Bay within a year of taking office. It is still open.</span><br><br>

<span style="color:#808080">Betsy McCaughey<br></span>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">Tell Santa to bring President Barack Obama a stocking stuffer: a copy of the US Constitution with the words "Laws be faithfully executed" underlined in red. Those words define the president's most important duty. But Obama, himself a constitutional lawyer, is ignoring the Constitution and governing like a dictator. His latest ploy exempts unions from a fee the Affordable Care Act imposes. Professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University, who voted for Obama and professes to agree with him on healthcare and other issues, didn't mince words when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 3. He warned that Obama's power grabs are causing "the most serious constitutional crisis I've seen in my lifetime." Several law professors and policy experts laid out a litany of the president's constitutional transgressions.</span><br><br>

<span style="color:#808080">Daniel Greenfield<br></span>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">Hardly a week goes by without Hillary Clinton receiving another award. Last month she was named a "Global Champion" by the International Medical Corps at a gala Beverly Hills event crowded with celebrities, received the American Patriot Award at the National Defense University Foundation in the Ronald Reagan Building and the Hermandad Award from the Mexican American Leadership Initiative. Considering that Hillary Clinton is as much of an American patriot as is she is a Mexican-American leader... both awards seem equally deserved. Hillary was honored by Malaria No More for taking the controversial position of being against malaria and by the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice for supporting internet freedom. Because nothing says a deep commitment to internet freedom like sending a man to jail for a year over a YouTube video that offended Muslims.</span><br><br>

<span style="color:#808080">Walter E. Williams<br></span>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">Let's examine a few statements reflecting a vision thought to be beyond question. "The world that we live in is beautiful but fragile." "The 3rd rock from the sun is a fragile oasis." Here are a couple of Earth Day quotes: "Remember that Earth needs to be saved every single day." "Remember the importance of taking care of our planet. It's the only home we have!" Such statements, along with apocalyptic predictions, are stock in trade for environmental extremists and non-extremists alike. Worse yet is the fact that this fragile-earth indoctrination is fed to our youth from kindergarten through college. Let's examine just how fragile the earth is. The 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, in present-day Indonesia, had the force of 200 megatons of TNT. That's the equivalent of 13,300 15-kiloton atomic bombs, the kind that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.</span><br><br></td>

<br><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:#808080">Ludwig von Mises Institute</span><br>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">What the media calls a "currency war," whereby nations engage in competitive currency devaluations in order to increase exports, is really "currency suicide." National governments persist in the fallacious belief that weakening one's own currency will improve domestically-produced products' competitiveness in world markets and lead to an export driven recovery. As it intervenes to give more of its own currency in exchange for the currency of foreign buyers, a country expects that its export industries will benefit with increased sales, which will stimulate the rest of the economy. So we often read that a country is trying to "export its way to prosperity." Mainstream economists everywhere believe that this tactic also exports unemployment to its trading partners by showering them with cheap goods and destroying domestic production and jobs.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:#808080">Reason.com</span><br>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">To achieve any ambitious goal, you have to want it badly enough to work and sacrifice. But there is such a thing as trying too hard. Overzealous pursuit of your heart's desire can end up chasing it away. The Chinese government may be learning that right now. China, a great civilization brought low by foreign powers in the 19th and 20th centuries, has long burned to acquire a global stature corresponding to its self-image. Its transformation from an economic catastrophe to an export machine has made it a much bigger player in world affairs. But sometimes efforts to assert itself generate, not respect and cooperation, but fear and resistance. The decision to establish an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea didn't have to set alarm bells clanging. Other countries have their own along their coastlines. But the Chinese didn't make the case; they just proclaimed it.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:#808080">The Gatestone Institute</span><br>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, an influential bloc of 57 Muslim countries, has released the latest edition of its annual "Islamophobia" report; a 94-page document purporting to "offer a comprehensive picture of Islamophobia, as it exists mainly in contemporary Western societies." But the primary objective of the OIC--headquartered in Saudi Arabia and funded by dozens of Muslim countries that systematically persecute Christians and Jews--has long been to pressure Western countries into passing laws that would ban "negative stereotyping of Islam." In this context, the OIC's annual Islamophobia report--an integral part of a sustained effort to prove the existence of a "culture of intolerance of Islam and Muslims" in the West--is a lobbying tool to pressure Western governments to outlaw all forms of "Islamophobia," a nebulous concept invented by the Muslim Brotherhood.</span>

<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">In a message released by al Qaeda's As Sahab on Dec. 7, Muhammad bin Mahmoud Rabie al Bahtiyti, an al Qaeda official, said the group is following current events in Egypt, even though it is "away from them." "[W]e would have liked to be among them [Egyptian Muslims], helping them and supporting them, and blocking off the assaults of the oppressors and the tyrants," al Bahtiyti said, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. "Even though we are away from them - and that is imposed on us - this does not prevent us from addressing them and their plight and doing out duty towards them." With regard to the ongoing crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood, al Bahtiyti argued that a peaceful approach will not do anything of importance. "Anyone who calls to resist falsehood with peacefulness is swimming in a sea of illusions," he declared.</span>

<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">Republicans in Congress have put in a dismal fiscal performance in 2013. The party could not come together to defund the disastrous Obamacare law. No progress was made tackling entitlements or eliminating programs. Republicans joined with Democrats to move ahead the wasteful farm bill. And the year began with a large income tax increase. Yesterday, Republican leaders reached a discretionary spending deal with the Democrats for 2014 and 2015 that blows up the 2011 Budget Control Act. That Act had been the GOP's only major spending accomplishment in years. The 2011 Act and related sequester have been bearing fruit and providing discretionary spending control the last two years. Now Republican leaders are throwing it away in return for revenue increases and spending trims that are mainly tiny and phony.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:#808080">Ludwig von Mises Institute</span><br>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">If one looks at the current paper money system and its negative social and social-political effects, the question must arise: where are the protests by the supporters and protectors of social justice? Why don't we hear calls to protest from politicians and social commentators, from the heads of social welfare agencies and leading religious leaders, who all promote the general welfare as their mission? Presumably, the answer is that many have only a weak understanding of the role of money in an economy with a division of labor, and for that reason, the consequences of today's paper money system are being widely overlooked. The current system of fractional reserve banking and central banking stands in stark opposition to a market economy monetary regime in which the market participants could decide themselves what money they want to use.<br></span>

<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">After you heard Pres. Obama's call for a hike in the minimum wage, you probably wondered the same thing I did: Was Obama sent from the future by Skynet to prepare humanity for its ultimate dominion by robots? But just in case the question didn't occur to you, let me explain. On Tuesday, the day before Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage, the restaurant chain Applebee's announced that it will install iPad-like tablets at every table. Chili's already made this move earlier this year. With these consoles customers will be able to order their meals and pay their checks without dealing with a waiter or waitress. Both companies insist that they won't be changing their staffing levels, but if you've read any science fiction, you know that's what the masterminds of every robot takeover say: "We're here to help. We're not a threat." But the fact is, the tablets are a threat.<br></span>

<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">With the Obama administration still under fire for scandalously abusing the IRS to target conservative and TEA Party organizations, a Democrat-led District Attorney's office in Wisconsin is making headlines nationwide for a controversial secret investigation of political forces that supported GOP Gov. Scott Walker. While details of the shadowy "John Doe" probe remain murky, multiple conservative political organizations and figures have reportedly been subjected to raids and subpoenas searching for evidence of potential campaign-law violations. Sources quoted in media reports said they did not know of any liberal groups or Democrat candidates contacted in the probe. According to news reports, dozens of conservative groups that backed Gov. Walker in his efforts to rein in government-employee unions and his subsequent recall election have been subpoenaed so far.<br></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:#808080">American Enterprise Institute</span><br>
<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">Pres. Obama wants to put inequality at the center of America's political discourse. Fine. Here's the opening question: "Does inequality matter?" The answer: "It depends." It depends on how governments react to inequality, it depends how developed the country is, it depends whether it's wealth inequality or income inequality. It also depends on how the wealthy got wealthy, according to a new study. In short: Inequality doesn't hurt a country, unless it results from government favors. Inequality can be messy to talk about, because it is entangled in many different concepts that need to be considered separately. For starters, poverty is bad. Every American has an obligation to feed the hungry and house the homeless, not just because it's the right thing to do but also because poverty drags down productivity and economic growth.</span>

<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">In an article that advocates for Common Core standards, the AP presents the typical talking points for supporters when faced with criticism that Common Core is a federal takeover of education. "The standards were created by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers to improve academic achievement and increase accountability. Pres. Obama and his administration embraced them." Actually, Mr. Obama did not simply "embrace" a concept that others developed; instead, the very roots of their version for Common Core are in the early ideas generated by him and his fellow radical community organizer, Bill Ayers. Just prior to the presidential election of 2008, it was observed that Mr. Obama's "most important executive experience" was heading up the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, an education foundation created by Bill Ayers.<br></span>

<span style="color:#000000; font-size: 11pt">The vast majority of Americans now believe that most people cannot be trusted. Not merely politicians or politically connected businesses, but most people period. According to a new AP poll, only one-third of Americans say they believe that most people can be trusted. Back in 1972, half of Americans believed this, when the same question was asked. The trust situation was already pretty bad back in 1972, and is very bad today. An interesting follow-up question would be: Do you find, in your experience in daily life, that most people can or cannot be trusted? I have a hunch that more than a mere third of the population, if asked, would say, I find that most people I encounter mean well and can be trusted. If correct, then theres a disconnect between how most Americans view people in general versus how they view actual people they encounter in their everyday lives.</span>

One of the speakers was the George Orwell professor of a British university. But his ideas were the opposite of Orwell. Orwell was a great patriot. On the contrary, this guy's definition of a nation was any random lines drawn on a mapno preconditions. He was no patriot. I guess a nation having values is invalid now. Also, Orwell was an anti-radical socialist, author of the amazing anti-radical Animal-Farm, and a milder, anti-totalitarian socialist who admired the United States. In contrast, the endowed professor had the opposite ideas and real politics of Orwell. After I challenged him on these modern "Progressive" (leftist) points, nobody spoke to me for the rest of the conference, because they just assumed what he said was true.</span>
