Two dozen legislators piled chairs in front of one door and chained another in the lower house, hours after the Senate approved a bill aimed at luring back foreign investors and ending the country&#039;s 75-year-old oil monopoly. It is a highly politicially sensitive issue in Mexico, where for decades its considerable oil wealth has been portrayed as everyone&#039;s resources. The barricade forced 401 deputies to pack into an auditorium in the congressional complex where they opened the debate on the legislation championed by the reform-driven President Enrique Pena Nieto.</p><br clear="all"/><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/budget-deal-offers-stability-pentagon-spending-204523725--politics.html" style="font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;display:block;border-top:1px solid #DDDDDD;padding-top:5px;">Budget deal offers stability to Pentagon spending</a><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/budget-deal-offers-stability-pentagon-spending-204523725--politics.html"><img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/CKYveTcMgCssoj8LZbLE4Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/080d4b50a7e1a129450f6a706700f4b1.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, left, joined by House Budget Committee Chairman Rep.

The cities, located throughout 18 states, saw requests for emergency food aid rise by an average of seven percent compared with the previous period a year earlier, according to the US Conference of Mayors study, published Wednesday. Around 43 percent of people who asked for food aid were employed, 21 percent were elderly and nine percent were homeless.

Mulally, 68, is one of a handful of candidates still in contention for the Microsoft role, according to several sources close to the technology giant, and he has not tried to dispel talk that he is interested in the job. That has begun to vex some on Ford&#039;s board, two sources told Reuters this week, and the issue will be discussed when the board meets in the Detroit area on Thursday. Microsoft declined comment on the progress of its CEO search, and a Ford spokesman repeated earlier statements that Mulally is slated to stay as Ford CEO through 2014, although it emerged in September that the board would be open to him leaving earlier than that. Even if Mulally does not take the Microsoft job, it is unlikely he will stay at Ford through the end of next year, the two sources said.</p><br clear="all"/><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/australia-39-top-court-overrules-gay-marriage-capital-015213530.html" style="font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;display:block;border-top:1px solid #DDDDDD;padding-top:5px;">Australia's top court overrules gay marriage in capital</a><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/australia-39-top-court-overrules-gay-marriage-capital-015213530.html"><img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/cRchnenhHw5keI2p.HfSsQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/9dc166bd1fe2732304b0c7971eb3c483ef4ee3a1.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="An Australian gay couple exchange vows during their marriage at Canberra&#039;s Old Parliament House on December 7, 2013" align="left" title="An Australian gay couple exchange vows during their marriage at Canberra&#039;s Old Parliament House on December 7, 2013" border="0" /></a>Australia&#039;s High Court on Thursday struck down gay marriage in the nation&#039;s capital where dozens have wed under a landmark law, ruling that parliament must decide whether to approve same-sex unions.

In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that the national parliament -- not state and territory authorities -- had the ultimate say over marriage and whether it was extended to same-sex couples was a matter for lawmakers.

Lawmakers in the lower house voted to bypass committees for energy and constitutional matters after leftists, who are railing against the bill in the world&#039;s No. 10 oil producer, padlocked doors to the chamber to prevent a debate. The stalling tactics by leftists are unlikely to block the bill, which passed the Senate with the backing of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and the opposition conservative National Action Party (PAN). The overhaul is designed to entice private oil companies to either operate independently in Mexico, or partner with state oil giant Pemex through production- and profit-sharing, service contracts and licenses.</p><br clear="all"/><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/budget-deal-headed-vote-u-house-passage-predicted-010650325--business.html" style="font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;display:block;border-top:1px solid #DDDDDD;padding-top:5px;">Budget deal headed to vote in U.S. House, passage predicted</a><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/budget-deal-headed-vote-u-house-passage-predicted-010650325--business.html"><img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/YzZwg53Iyx9sjWUJ_q0Ptw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2013-12-11T183204Z_3_CBRE9BA1CT500_RTROPTP_2_USA-FISCAL.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Murray and Ryan hold a news conference to introduce The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the U.S. Capitol in Washington" align="left" title="Murray and Ryan hold a news conference to introduce The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the U.S. Capitol in Washington" border="0" /></a>By David Lawder and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday were falling in line behind a bipartisan two-year budget deal, indicating that the normally rambunctious group of lawmakers is not spoiling for a year-end fiscal fight.
