<p>	DUMMERSTON, Vt. -- Now that the so-called fiscal cliff - a crisis that was manufactured by the least productive, least popular Congress in history - has been temporarily averted, what actually got accomplished? 	<ul><li> Families earning more than $450,000 a year are going to see a modest increase in their income taxes, from 35 percent to the 39.5 percent level of the Clinton years. 	<li> Taxes on capital gains and dividend taxes for families in that income group will rise from 15 percent to the Clinton era-level of 20 percent. 	<li> The estate tax will be set at 40 percent for families in that income group, with a $5 million exemption that is indexed to inflation. 	<li> The Alternative Minimum Tax got permanently patched to avert automatic tax increases on middle class taxpayers. 	<li> The Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the American Opportunity Tax Credit - three important tax credits for lower-income Americans - were extended for five years. 	<li> Scheduled reimbursement cuts to doctors under Medicare were postponed for one year, as were cuts to long-term unemployment benefits. 	<li> A temporary nine-month extension to the Farm Bill, necessary because Republicans failed to pass one last fall, that will avert a collapse of the current federal milk price support system and a doubling of retail milk prices; 	<li> And a two-month delay in automatic spending cuts.</ul> <p>

<p>
<b>by Erik Deckers	</b>
<p>	INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. -- I recently heard a story on National Public Radio about Leonardo da Vinci's "To Do" list, related by historian Toby Lester in his new book, "da Vinci's Ghost." 	The Renaissance Man used to organize his thoughts. Whenever something caught his eye, said Lester, da Vinci would scribble a few notes or start sketching his ideas in his notebook. 										That's because da Vinci believed it was useful to "constantly observe, note, and consider" the things he saw around him. And many of those notes and sketches resulted in some of his most famous paintings, drawings, ideas, and inventions - some of which we still know, use and are inspitred by today. 											I've done the same thing for years, although not with the same effect and accomplishment as the industrious Italian. Most of my long-lasting contributions are boob jokes, and not even good ones at that.									But I do have one thing that Toby Lester doesn't have. It's an old copy of one of Leonardo da Vinci's diaries, which I have translated into English. These are a few of the highlights:<p>  	<b>September 19, 1487</b> - One of my assistants told me about some guy in the next village who was born with four arms and four legs. Totally have to draw this guy. No one's going to believe this at all. Not even sure I do.<p>  	<b>November 4, 1487</b> - Found the four-armed guy. His name is Wendell. He really does have four arms and legs. Was hoping he'd have two heads or something cool like that. But no, it's just the one guy with an extra pair of limbs. Dude runs like a horse though. Watched him outrun a group of villagers on horseback. Of course, he can't fight at all, although a slapfight by a four-armed man is pretty hilarious.<p>  	<b>June 13, 1488</b> - Had an idea for a flying machine. Been watching all these birds, and started sketching some ideas. I'll have to get around to building one of these things. Would be very useful for flying from home to the office. I'd need to figure out a way to launch the machine though. Maybe a giant crossbow...<p>  	<b>March 15, 1492</b> - Was just fired by Ludovico from the Big Horse project. Was supposed to cast a giant horse statue made out of bronze, but Michelangelo torpedoed the whole project. Put a bug in Lou's ear that he didn't think I was up to the task.  <p>

<p>	BRADENTON, Fla., July 8, 2011 -- There's lots of ways to kill a thing.  You can starve it to death, or poison it.  You can take away its functions, one by one or all at once.  You can put a frog in a pot of cold water and turn on a burner under the pot, and it won't realize until it's way too late, if at all, that it's being boiled to death - that's killing it softly, or slowly.  You can kill it all at once, as with a gunshot.  You can stab it and let it bleed to death.  You can feed it tiny bits of radium or mercury for a little while or lead for a long time and let it die.  There's just a myriad of ways to kill - as Shakespeare had Cleopatra say in Antony & Cleopatra, "I have pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die." She chose an asp, as you would call a scorpion, and she pressed it to her breast. <p>

I have been reading about the millimeter wave and backscatter X-ray machines and the possible harm to health as well as the vivid pictures they create of people's naked bodies. Not wanting to go through them, I had done myresearch on the TSA's Web site prior to traveling to see if SAN had them. From all indications, they did not. When I arrived at the security line, I found that the TSA's Web site was out of date. SAN does in fact utilize backscatter X-ray machines. <p>
