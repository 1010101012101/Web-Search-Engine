Friendster pioneered social networking and ignited the social media industry that has created billion dollar companies such as Facebook and Twitter, companies that may not have existed in their present form if not for Friendster's early innovation.</span></div>  <div><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "></span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><br />  </span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Today, Friendster is in a unique position to take advantage on the growth of social gaming. Through its relationship with MOL, which has a 10 year history in working with gaming companies, Friendster has both the experience and track record to make innovations in this space.</span></div>  <div><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "></span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><br />  </span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Today, as Friendster reinvents itself as a social gaming destination that enables its users to create multiple avatars, play games and enjoy rewards; I hope that all of you will wish us luck and continue to support us in our new reincarnation. The new Friendster is not perfect and we will continue to add new games and features such as localization and rewards over the next few months. Our team is working hard on adding these features and welcomes your suggestions and comments on how we can better serve your needs as a social gaming and entertainment destination.</span></div>  <div><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "></span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><br />  </span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your support and hope that all of you will enjoy the new Friendster as Friendster continues to innovate to serve and entertain you better.</span></div>  <div><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "></span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><br />  </span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Yours truly,</span></div>  <div><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "></span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><br />  </span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Ganesh Kumar Bangah</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><br />  </span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Chief Executive Officer</span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><br />  </span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><a href="mailto:ceo@friendster.com">ceo@friendster.com</a></span></div>  <p class="postFooter">

              <h3>Thursday, June 30, 2011</h3><a name="p696326" id="p696326"></a><h4>More Details on MySpace Sale</h4><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">While complete terms of the deal were not disclosed (and News Corp will continue to own a small stake in the company), Specific Media has brought in JT (Justin Timberlake) as part owner and active player in MySpace's future according to <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/news-corp-sells-myspace-to-specific-media-for-35-million/?hpw" class="ApplyClass">this New York Times story</a>:</p>  </span><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">The sale closes a complex chapter in the history of the Internet and of the News Corporation, which was widely envied by other media companies when it acquired MySpace in 2005. At that time, MySpace was the worlds fastest-growing social network, with 20 million unique visitors each month in the United States. That figure soon soared to 70 million, but the network could not keep pace with Facebook, which overtook MySpace two years ago.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">As users fled MySpace, so, too, did advertisers. The market research firm eMarketer estimates that the site will earn about $183 million in worldwide ad revenue this year, down from $605 million at its peak, when the site introduced many Web users and many advertisers to the concept of social networking.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">Its a shame that MySpaces value has diminished so severely since the acquisition; MySpaces pioneering of social networking (now referred to as social media) will always be revered as igniting a new medium, Richard Rosenblatt, the chairman of MySpace at the time of the sale to the News Corporation, said in an e-mail.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">Instead of envy, the News Corporations bet on MySpace now provokes punch lines. Tom Freston, who was fired as the chief executive of Viacom in part for failing to buy MySpace, joked in an interview with CNBC earlier this year that Im still waiting for a thank-you note from the Viacom chairman, Sumner M. Redstone.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">Mr. Freston, who was in Iceland on Wednesday and said he was smiling at the news of an impending MySpace sale, declined to comment.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">News Corporation executives declined interview requests on Wednesday.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">It is not clear whether MySpace itself was profitable for the company. The division that houses MySpace and other digital properties has turned a profit only once in the last six years. An advertising deal with Google helped the company to recoup what it spent on MySpace in the first place, but the site became a burden on the companys earnings; by last year executives were calling the losses unacceptable. Mr. Nathanson called the site a headache.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">What doomed the site? Lee Brenner, the former director of MySpaces Impact section who is now the publisher of HyperVocal, wrote in a blog post Tuesday, Im sure most employees (former or current) will argue that it was poor management, or a need to hit revenue targets once News Corp. took over, or a bottleneck in the technology department, or lack of resources given to their division, or a poor public relations effort, etc., that set the course of MySpaces downfall.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">Any number of these could be true, he continued. I suppose well never know for sure. It is most likely a combination of these factors, along with a low attention span public. It probably didnt help to be doing business, and trying to grow, along with all of these issues, in the midst of a global economic crisis.</p>  </span><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: 10px; color: #333333; ">  <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.5em; ">MySpace has tried to reboot itself several times, most recently as a social destination for music, movies and other media. It has not been abandoned altogether: it still has 35 million visitors a month in the United States, according to the measurement company comScore. Facebook has 157 million visitors a month in the United States.</p>  </span></blockquote>  <p class="postFooter">

              <h3>Sunday, April 25, 2010</h3><a name="p655773" id="p655773"></a><h4>Death of Customer Service: Delta Airlines to Silver Medallion: Screw You</h4>So just when I was about to write an update about Delta Airlines to commend them from the changes and improvement in customer service agents, Delta slams its loyal customers -- without warning -- with a new program that screws even those Delta fliers who had Silver Medallion status. And Delta gave its "loyal" customers a two-day notice to implement this new program.<div><br /></div><div>So, suddenly, those people who purchased a Sky Club membership which gave them access to fast security lines were held holding a membership for club rooms that are increasingly full and don't even provide the most important amenity of priority security lines. Delta is starting to look a lot like FlyClear, the now bankrupt service that screwed a lot of travelers, too. And, oh yeah, the few Silver Medallion members who used to be in Zone 1 have now been bumped down to Zone 2. </div><div><br /></div><div>When we asked the agent at the Sky Club entrance, even she thought these changes were "ridiculous"! If your customer service folks at the frontlines think you've come up with a program that sucks, maybe you should be rethinking your strategy.</div><div><br /></div><div>So here's what Delta had to say to one Silver Medallion member (so that they can squeeze more dollars out of each loyal frequent flier -- if you can't reach Gold status with just your flying, come spend money with us via our American Expres credit cards):</div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; "><blockquote type="cite"><div topmargin="0" bottommargin="0" leftmargin="0" rightmargin="0" bgcolor="#F9F9F9" link="#006699" vlink="#006699" background="http://f.e.delta.com/i/19/2068312564/dr9r28_bg_gradient.gif" style="overflow-y: scroll; "><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="overflow-y: scroll; background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); background-image: url(http://f.e.delta.com/i/19/2068312564/dr9r28_2_bg_gradient_1800px.gif); ">    <tbody>        <tr>            <td><center>            <table width="680" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">                <tbody>                    <tr>                        <td align="left" valign="top" style="width: 644px; ">                        <table width="644" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                            <tbody>                                <tr>                                    <td align="left" valign="top" style="width: 604px; ">                                    <table width="604" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                        <tbody>                                            <tr>                                                <td align="left" valign="top" style="width: 604px; "><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); ">We hope you're enjoying all the benefits of your 2010 Silver Medallion® status.

              <h3>Friday, March 20, 2009</h3><a name="p602200" id="p602200"></a><h4>Death of customer service: Delta Airlines (Part 2)</h4>So what's with Delta selling you tickets without assigning you a seat number? Either Delta has a ticket to sell -- and a seat that goes with it -- or it doesn't. <div><br /></div><div>Does anyone understand why it is OK for an airline to inconvenience passengers (beyond making us fly them) by not letting passengers print a boarding pass at home (since there's no seat number for them) even 24 hours before their flight?<div><br /></div><div>Instead, they make you print some sort of other document -- which says you have a confirmed reservation but no seat -- which you're then forced to take to the customer "service" desk at the airport (after getting there much earlier than one normally needs to). Invariably, one then has to deal with an unfriendly Delta customer service person who thinks they're doing you a favor -- instead of simply being able to walk thru security and to your gate if you're not checking bags and have already printed your boarding pass.</div><div><br /></div><div>And, second, what's with all the seats Delta is saving for its most frequent fliers but still selling you a ticket and not letting you actually pick a seat. Again, either you're being sold a ticket and a seat that accompanies it or you're not. Or you're being asked to buy a standby ticket. But to sell you a confirmed ticket without a confirmed seat that goes with it should be against the law. Delta seems to think it can have it both ways while forcing passengers to waste their time. Enough already.</div><div><br /></div><div>As I've said before, maybe Skywest should take over all of Delta's operation. The Delta service on the small planes run by Skywest is always excellent.</div></div><p class="postFooter">

              <h3>Sunday, March 15, 2009</h3><a name="p601300" id="p601300"></a><h4>Death of customer service: Delta Airlines</h4>Some Delta's customer service personnel should be fired. In this economy, I'm sure there are may other competent folks out there who'd love to have a job and have at least basic customer service skills. Some of the current employees (especially the ones manning the SFO terminal 1 desk around 2 pm on Sunday, March 15) have obviously become too complacent. Their attitude needs a major readjustment -- if not total replacement.<div><br /></div><div>As we were walking to the terminal we were informed via telephone alerts that our flight from SFO to SLC would be late. Seems like at least the Delta automated system is effective and polite. As is their affiliate of Skywest Airlines. But I can't say the same about the Delta personnel. Maybe Skywest personnel should replace them all?</div><div><br /></div><div><div>So here's what happpend. The airport was mostly deserted and the line for Delta had only one person ahead of us checking in with three Delta employees hovering over that one customer. Yes, one could come up with a joke about it -- how may Delta employees does it take to check in one passenger? Three. One to actually do the job and two to waste their time while other passengers look on.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once they'd made us wait. Quite deliberately because, hey, we needed to be put in our place as customers. One of the guys finally decided to help us with the following question first: "Is it quick?" I'm sorry but did the bozo behind the counter just first check with us whether we'd be wasting his time? Why, because he was 007 in disguse about to head off to fight the enemy? Because he needed to go pee? Actually, not our problem but obnoxious as hell.</div><div><br /></div><div>And the excuse for the delay? The SFO Air Traffic Control isn't letting their planes land because there's a little bit of fog. SFO is used to fog. And there's not that much fog. Plus, if they knew that the plane was still sitting on the tarmac in Salt Lake City, it would have been nice to let us know about it as soon as they knew about the delay. Rather than making us sit around at SFO for three or four hours...for a one-hour and fifteen minute flight.</div><div><br /></div><div>Time for a makeover, Delta, if you want to get out of this recession alive...rather than becoming the GM of the airlines.</div></div><p class="postFooter">

              <h3>Saturday, February 14, 2009</h3><a name="p596197" id="p596197"></a><h4>Death of customer service: Virgin Atlantic</h4>    <div>Why has <span><a href="http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/">Virgin Atlantic</a></span> turned its <span><a href="http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/en/us/customerrelations/contact_us/phone.jsp">customer service phone system</a></span> into a convoluted nightmare that makes it impossible to find a live agent at first try?</div>  <div><br />  </div>  <div>Virgin Atlantic is/was? considered one of the shining stars when it comes to service as I wrote almost two years ago in <span><a href="http://www.blogit.com/Blogs/Blog.aspx/readyfireaim/460544">this blog entry</a></span>.  <div><br />  </div>  <div>Is Virgin Atlantic going the same way as most mediocre companies? Unless you're flying Upper Class? Is Customer Service now all about class, too?</div>  <div><br />  </div>  <div>Try calling Virgin's 1-800 number and you'll understand what I mean. It is straight out of a comedy except that it isn't a movie...it is Virgin's reality. Compare this to <span><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Computer's</a></span> customer service. You get thru to a live agent, if that's what you want, immediately and they're actually helpful and want you to get to a solution. That wasn't my experience with Virgin today as I tried to reconfirm a flight for my mom.</div>  <div><br />  </div>  <div>When will businesses realize that making customers frustrated, rather than helping them out, is not the best way to do business. Ever. But especially not in a major economic downturn. In times like these customers don't stop spending money completely...they just focus on the things (and the businesses) that most deserve to get our money. </div>  <div><br />  </div>  <div>So we eat at SantaCafe and not the Compound. We shop at Zegna and not Neiman. We support the nonprofits that treat us best and deserve our contributions. We fly...OK, never mind on that one. It is hard to figure out which airline these days bothers to treat you well unless you're their 1K member or flying first class or the brother of the pilot!</div>  </div>  <p class="postFooter">

This year a mere ten designers still qualify as purveyors of haute couture according to this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117754699650682796-search.html?KEYWORDS=haute+couture&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month">WSJ story</a> (subscription required). </p>  <p>"The term "haute couture" is protected under law by the French Ministry of Industry, and only those designated by the Chamber as couturiers can use the term -- which translates loosely as "high fashion," though the word couture technically means "sewing." (The legal protection does not extend to the use of the word couture alone.)"</p>  <p>"the haute couture tradition dates to Charles Frederick Worth, a 19th-century Englishman-turned-Parisian who showed his ideas on live models and enjoyed the patronage of Napoleon III. In 1868, the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture was created to enforce rules involving fabrics, numbers of employees, and numbers of designs for day and evening wear. This was so strict and costly that only the best of the best could qualify. By the mid-20th century, more than 100 haute couture houses competed earnestly for well-heeled clientele by following the stringent set of rules: sewing by hand, with employees who are French, in ateliers that are French, in France."</p>  <p>So, just in case you thought otherwise, Juicy Couture isn't really couture! :)</p></span>  <p class="postFooter">

Abraham Ravid, a professor of economics and finance at <a title="More articles about Rutgers" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/rutgers_the_state_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><font color=#004276>Rutgers University</font></a>, who, in a 1999 study of almost 200 films released between 1991 and 1993, found that once one considered other factors influencing the success of a film, a star had no impact on its rate of return. Employing a star had virtually no discernible impact on the box office itself. Mr. Cruise would no doubt object to that assertion. And to be fair, there is some theoretical pedigree to the idea that he may be worth every penny. In fact, there is a whole branch of economics that aims to explain how talented people generate so much more money than competitors who are only slightly less good. Its called superstar economics.</p></blockquote><p class="postFooter">

              <h3>Thursday, July 20, 2006</h3><a name="p389836" id="p389836"></a><h4>Doing GOOD</h4><p>According to this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115335722100411900.html?mod=hps_us_at_glance_mm">WSJ story</a> (subscription required), one heir is trying to do GOOD. I think it's a great idea who's time has come, and if done right, the publication could reach many younger people (rich and not so rich) who want to do good with however much money they have to give. </p>  <p>We're not philanthropists. We're not just wanting to give away money for the sake of giving money, nor for the social or other benefits some giving brings. We want our money put to good use. We want to see change. To see our money make a visible difference...not squandered on reinventing the wheel or competing with other like-minded organizations.</p>  <p>For the first time last year, we pulled a financial commitment to a nonprofit because it wasn't taking advantage of the other organizations that were already in the field doing complementary work. Even though we met with the Managing Director (the ED was too busy to meet) and conveyed our concerns, they were more keen to tell us that they knew what they were doing and how much experience they had running nonprofits. Well they lost us not only as donors but also as supporters, and it appears from the most recent invitation to their LA fundraiser, we weren't the only ones they lost.</p>  <blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">  <p>Bernie Goldhirsh, the founder of Inc. magazine, amassed his fortune by selling entrepreneurs ideas on how to make money. Now, his son Ben is trying to make money by telling people how to give something back.</p>  <p>...With some of that money, his 26-year-old son plans to launch a magazine in September called GOOD with a dual purpose: build a profitable business and serve as a platform for people looking to do good. Mr. Goldhirsh is funding the initial $2.5 million start-up cost himself, and he has assembled a core group of about 12 employees -- all under 30.</p></blockquote><p class="postFooter">

According to this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115255814013802582.html?mod=mostpop">Wall Street Journal story</a>&nbsp;(subscription required):</p>  <blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">  <p class=times><a class=times onmouseover="window.status=('   Quotes &amp; Research for NFLX');return true" onmouseout="window.status=('');return true" href="http://online.wsj.com/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=nflx">Netflix</a> Inc., which boasts nearly five million members, often trumpets how its all-you-can-eat rental model is changing the way people are watching movies. But Netflix may also be changing the way people don't watch them. Through its Web site, Netflix makes it easy to comb through a massive catalog of 60,000 films. It offers access to everything from Charlie Chaplin's 1921 silent tramp movie "The Kid" to recent Academy Award-winners like "Crash." And some members admit that when browsing the Netflix backlog, they overestimate their appetite for off-the-beaten-track films. The result: Sometimes DVDs languish for months without being watched.</p>  <p class=times>"It's a paradox of abundance," said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of culture and communication at New York University. If people aren't pressured to see a movie in a specific time frame, he said, viewers tend to put it lower on their priority list. "When you have every choice in front of you, you have less urgency about any particular choice," he added.</p></blockquote><p class="postFooter">

Americans tend to flock to the same small group of movies, just as they flock to the same candy bars and cars, right?</p>  <p>Well, the actual answer is 35,000 to 40,000. That's right: every day, almost two of every three movies ever put onto DVD are rented by a Netflix customer. "Americans' tastes are really broad," says Reed Hastings, Netflix's chief executive. So, while the studios spend their energy promoting bland blockbusters aimed at everyone, Netflix has been catering to what people really want  and helping to keep Hollywood profitable in the process.</p></blockquote><p class="postFooter">
