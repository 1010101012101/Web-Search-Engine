<p>Um, shouldn&#8217;t the investigation have been ordered in early October, when it was already clear healthcare.gov had massive problems and not just before HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius&#8217; appearance before a hostile House committee?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know why a third tier company, CGI Federal, was given a no-bid contract, after they&#8217;d failed building a similar heathcare website for Canada, and why other contractors also got no-bid contracts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a software developer. 10 percent of Healthcare.gov applications currently sent to insurers have errors, down from 25% in October. This is beyond unacceptable. An invoicing system where 10% of the invoices had errors would be a train wreck. An error rate this high means all applications have to be manually re-checked to insure they are accurate. Sending data to another computer is not complicated or rocket science. It&#8217;s difficult to understand how it got so screwed up.</p>
<blockquote><p>Questions also remain about the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/sebelius-obamacare-website-investigation-100999.html">accuracy of application files</a> that insurers are receiving from HealthCare.gov and state-run health insurance exchanges. After weeks of media scrutiny, the administration last week said about 10 percent of the application files, known as the “834” files, sent to insurers currently contain erroneous information – down from about 25 percent in October.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have a broken health care system. People can&#8217;t get the help they need, and the broken parts don&#8217;t communicate with each other &#8211; as witness this story.</p>
<p>A woman, married and with a child, got pregnant. Her family&#8217;s income was about the median for her county, which made her eligible for Medicaid as a result of her pregnancy. Unfortunately, she miscarried. There followed several months of unexplained abdominal pains. Doctors and specialists were unable to diagnose them. They told her if she was in pain, go to the ER, which she did about a dozen times over six months. The ER, of course, treated the pain but did no diagnostics. They told her to go back to her primary care doctor for diagnosis. But neither the primary care doctor nor the specialists were able to identify a cause for her pain.</p>
<p>Then one day, a PA in the ER flagged her as a possible drug seeker because of her frequent visits. As a result, Medicaid put her on restriction, which means that only her primary care doctor can prescribe for her, and she can&#8217;t see any other doctor without a referral, and she can only get her prescriptions filled at one pharmacy (Walmart).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the fun part: her doctor told her to get a flu shot. Medicaid covers flu shots. However, Walmart doesn&#8217;t offer them, and since she is restricted to one pharmacy, she was unable to get one that was covered by her insurance.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s even more fun: she got pregnant again. She&#8217;s allowed to see an OB/GYN, because her primary care doctor referred her. But the OB is not allowed to prescribe for her, nor refer her to any other specialists. For that, she has to go back to her primary care doctor. The average wait time for an appointment is ten days. Ten days, when a woman is pregnant, can make the difference between a healthy baby and a miscarriage.</p>
<p>Her nine-year-old son was also eligible for Medicaid, until the family bought a $2,000 car. Medicaid determined that the car was actually worth $4,000, which put the family over the $3,500 limit for personal assets. That disqualified the son from Medicaid. There is no appeal over the value of a vehicle &#8211; they use a table that overrules both actual and market price.</p>
<p>I think Medicaid is a great program. But our system is so flawed that it doesn&#8217;t work for many people.</p>

			<p class="post_date"><a href="http://polizeros.com" title="Visit Bob Morris&#8217;s website" rel="author external">Bob Morris</a> &nbsp;Posted on Tue Dec 10, 2013 7:36 am. <span class="singletags"></span></p>

				<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37149" alt="RenewableEnergy" src="http://polizeros.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/RenewableEnergy.jpg" width="360" height="239" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the grid &#8211; and NIMBYs and subsidies. It&#8217;s increasingly clear renewable energy cannot replace carbon-based and nuclear power.</p>
<p>Our electrical grid requires supply and demand always be perfectly in balance. Renewable energy makes that much harder to do because its power production fluctuates and cannot be predicted in advance. Coal and nuclear power plants provide all-important baseline power, that is, they produce power 24/7 regardless of weather or time of day. It is misguided to shut them down due to environmental or safety concerns until solid replacements are up and running.</p>
<p>In addition, huge subsidies for renewable are distorting prices and it&#8217;s unclear whether there is even enough suitable area to install the ginormous wind and solar plants needed to bring the US to even 10% total renewable energy. And that&#8217;s assuming they could be installed, given NIMBY opposition (which is sometimes quite justified.) I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to pave the Mojave Desert in California with solar plants, something some renewable boosters think would just be a wonderful idea, a view shared by investments banks and big money who see the possibilities of captive customers paying steep prices.</p>
<blockquote><p>Managing the uninterrupted transfer of electrical power from myriad sources wherever and whenever it is needed is a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/12/10/green-power-gridlock-why-renewable-energy-is-no-alternative/">hugely complicated challenge</a>. It’s one thing when the principal supply sources use gas, heat or hydraulically-driven turbines which provide constant, unfluctuating outputs that can be adjusted and counted upon independent of weather or season.</p>
<p>But circumstances become increasingly complex as more and more intermittent sources are added to the power supply mix. Difficulties arise as segments of the grid become overloaded or underserved by the renewables, requiring the conventional-source turbines which balance the grid to meet base demand loads be repeatedly throttled down and up. This reduces turbine operating efficiencies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Beware the &#8220;Santa Clausification&#8221; of Nelson Mandela say Adam Curry and John Dvorak their No Agenda podcast #572, quoting Cornel West. Mandela was a communist and used violence in his early days. He never renounced it and was uncompromising, as revolutionaries generally are. And he changed the world and inspired millions, even if he may have fallen short of his goals, as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/if-nelson-mandela-really-had-won">Zizek says</a>.</p>
<p>So, No Agenda and Cornel West say, honor Mandela for what he was, not for the Disney image the media is trying to portray him as. (No Agenda is available on iTunes)</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2013/12/07/cornel-west-we-are-witnessing-santa-clausification-nelson-mandela">Are we covering up</a> some of the realities of how individuals regarded both the ANC and more specifically, Nelson Mandela in all these eulogies?</p>
<p>CORNEL WEST: I think no doubt we are. I mean, Nelson Mandela&#8217;s a spiritual giant, moral titan, and political revolutionary. We are witnessing the Santa Clausification of Nelson Mandela. We turned the revolutionary into an old man, a huggable old man with toys in a bag, smile on his face, no threat to anybody, domesticated, tamed, and no longer really full of the fire.</p>
<p>But we know at 95, brother Nelson Mandela was still full of fire. He had that militant tenderness and subversive sweetness and radical gentleness tied to refusing to be fearful or intimidated in the face of a vicious white supremacist apartheid regime.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/11/at-what-moment-did-our-country-become.html">Borderland Beat ponders</a> the deranged violence in Mexico, fueled by drug cartels and corruption, and wonders how it ever got so crazy. What they say applies here in the States. No, we don&#8217;t have the same sickening levels of violence, with thousands of <a href="http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/12/the-ninos-sicarios-who-behead-use-drugs.html">young teen torturers</a> and killers. However, too many of our financial institutions benefit hugely from laundering drug cartel money. And that is one reason why Mexico went off the tracks. The elites in Mexico  initially profited from the drug trade and corruption (and still do) so they were willing to be complicit. Then their own children got addicted, tortured, and murdered &#8211; or became killers themselves &#8211; and suddenly they were in far too deep to get out.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, our outlook is dominated by poverty, inequality, social exclusion, lack of opportunity, corruption, impunity, weak institutions, and meager economic growth. Thanks to these variables, the violence associated with organized crime and drug trafficking found favorable footholds to flourish and obtain million-dollar earnings at the cost of the destruction of forward-looking perspectives and the development of the entire country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Inequality, as we all know, is rising fast in the US too. A protected 1% elite has corrupted the government and remains mostly above and outside of) the law.</p>
<blockquote><p>The family ceased to be the cornerstone of society, social ties became increasingly fragile, and our values—which once distinguished us in the world—were replaced by anti-values such as hatred, intolerance, and individualism.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is happening here too. What used to bond and hold us together is disappearing.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Polish philosopher and sociologist Zygmunt Brauman states in his book Collateral Damage: Social Inequalities in a Global Age:</p>
<p>“When an electric circuit is overloaded the first part to burn is the fuse… The effectiveness and the duration of the entire circuit—and as a consequence, the electricity that it is capable of absorbing and the work that it is capable of performing—cannot be greater than the resistance of the fuse. Once the fuse blows, the entire circuit fails.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Are the circuits about to fail here too? We also need to ask, just why does the United States have such an insatiable demand for drugs?</p>

<p>TechCrunch, in a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/07/a-modest-proposal">stirring Op-Ed</a>, calls for US out of Silicon Valley, as it is the center of the universe and deserves special status. A Special Regulatory Zone will be established in gritty, crime-ridden Oakland. It will be the first Panopticon drone state, completely monitoring its populace 24/7, free from onerous governmental regulations, ruled by benevolent tech overlords. How the new boss will be different from the old boss is a bit unclear. However, we are taking Silicon Valley here, so surely their special wonderfulness will create a entrepreneur&#8217;s paradise, free from intrusion by the damned gummint. Plus, Silicon Valley will no longer have to lie about how they don&#8217;t monitor the public and the possibilities of profiting by selling the data to NSA are awesome indeed.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m confident that the imposition of a Special Regulatory Zone organized by Silicon Valley’s finest tech minds would be welcomed by most of Oakland, much as a grateful Iraqi population greeted their American liberators a decade ago.</p>
<p>We may however need to tweak the demographics of the Special Regulatory Zone a little for testing purposes. To make space, Luddites, hipsters, and other technological throwbacks could be humanely resettled to camps in the Central Valley, where I’m given to understand that there’s a thriving informal economy of agriculture jobs that can support them.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, I&#8217;m afeared it will never work. Oakland gangs will view the naive, cloistered techies as easy pickings and hordes of left-wing Berkeley politicos will hack through the Panopticon and wreck their libertarian wet dream. very sad.</p>
