<h4 style="font-style: normal; margin-top: 15px">Death of founder editor</h4>

<p>Geoffrey Goodman, chairman emeritus of <i>British Journalism Review</i> and its founding editor and subsequently its chairman, died on September 5 at the age of 91. He will be sorely missed throughout journalism as a champion of the trade and a constant campaigner for higher editorial standards and by the <i>BJR</i> for his tireless enthusiasm and devotion to the journal.</p>

<p><IMG SRC="images/geoffrey_goodman.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 35px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid black" ALT="Geoffrey Goodman" WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="364">An RAF pilot during war service, 1941-46, he studied at the London School of Economics before joining the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, <i>News Chronicle</i> and <i>Daily Herald</i>. Specialising in industrial reporting and commentating, he went on to join the <i>Daily Mirror</i> in 1969, where he remained as an assistant editor and columnist until his retirement from the paper in 1986. He was a member of the third Royal Commission on the Press and co-author of its Minority Report.</p>

<p>A co-founder of <i>British Journalism Review</i>, he edited the journal for 13 years while also remaining active as a writer and broadcaster. His books include <i>The Awkward Warrior</i> (1979), a biography of the trade union leader Frank Cousins; <i>The Miners’ Strike</i> (1985), a history of the 1984-5 strike; <i>The State of the Nation</i> (1997), an analysis of the political legacy of Aneurin Bevan; and <i>From Bevan to Blair</i> (2003), a memoir of 50 years of political reporting. He was awarded the CBE in 1998 for his services to journalism.</p>

<p>The second media conference to be co-hosted by the <i>BJR</i> and the University of Westminster culminated in the presentation of the annual Charles Wheeler Award for Contribution to Broadcast Journalism and a keynote speech by Mayor of London Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>The conference, which attracted academics from the UK and abroad as well as many journalists and students, was held at the University’s Regent Street, London, campus on June 8 and 9, with BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen receiving his award from Lady Wheeler, the late BBC foreign correspondent’s widow, on the second evening. Accepting the Award, Bowen said the BBC’s loss of self-confidence and introspection was not justified, and the corporation should be proud of its global and national status.</p>
<p>Mayor Johnson, formerly an editor of <i>The Spectator</i> still a columnist with <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, spoke on the shifting power game between politics and media, wickedly challenging the BBC’s “lack of accountability” in not revealing the salaries paid to many top executives. Johnson said he asked <i>Newsnight</i> presenter Jeremy Paxman – winner of the Wheeler Award last year – how much he earns 14 times, but didn’t obtain an answer.</p>
<p>Both the University and the <i>BJR</i> again indicated that they hope both conference and award will be an annual event in the media calendar.</p>

<H4>Cudlipp Award winner</H4>

The 2007 <i>BJR</i> Cudlipp Award &mdash; commemorating the journalism of the great
editor and editorial director Hugh Cudlipp &mdash; was presented as part of the
British Press Awards at Grosvenor House, London, on April 8. The judges
observed that a new high was set both numerically and in the overall
standard of the entries, and said that those responsible for all the work
submitted should be proud of their journalistic excellence. The judges were
especially impressed by Tom Newton Dunn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Friendly fire&rdquo; series in <i>The Sun</i>
(already an award-winner); a <i>Daily Record</i> team&rsquo;s extraordinary tracing of
victims of a 40-year-old murder case; and the <i>Daily Mirror&rsquo;s</i> campaign on
behalf of the Gurkha war heroes &mdash; a remarkable piece of journalism very
much in the Hugh Cudlipp tradition.<p>

But eventually it was another campaign that emerged as the winner: the
dramatic and sustained support for British troops returning from
Afghanistan and Iraq and a successful appeal for funds to extend a forces&rsquo;
rehabilitation centre. For the very Cudlippian project, &ldquo;Help for Heroes&rdquo;,
the Cudlipp Award went to <i>The Sun</i>.<p>-->

<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">&ldquo;Everyone says the Leveson Inquiry will result in a new
governing body for the press. That ambition is either
futile or stupidly small in scale. What we want to see is
an end to villainy (and “hatchet jobs”) but with nothing
lost: privacy, decency and freedom of speech cherished
together, each protected without damaging the other. If
we can identify people clear and ethical enough to want
the same, clever enough to find the balance,
incorruptible enough to stick with it &mdash; and who are
happy to accept power, yet without a dangerous thirst
for it &mdash; then those people should not be in charge of
newspapers. They should be in charge of everything.&rdquo;<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">&ldquo;I want to be regulated, I want to be held to high standards &mdash; I don’t
want the impact of my journalism to be tainted by even a hint of
questionable ethics. I think it is absolutely right that there is a regulator
that people can go to. Who are we to be above the opportunity for
people to review what we’ve done? Furthermore I do not want to find
my own editors somewhere in the mix. I want an objective regulator.
I’m no Ofcom sycophant, but I’m afraid they have done an excellent
job regulating my end of television: firm, fair, and intelligent… What
are these print guys afraid of &mdash; if their story is right, is justified, they
have nothing to fear from a regulator? Even the most hardened of
tabloid journalists must have been mortified, embarrassed, even
shocked at the rubbish that has tipped across Leveson’s desk; what age
do these supposed journalists and editors who are the agents of this
stuff live in… what lives do they live?</p>

<p>Of course, papers and TV are entirely different beasts… but I see
no reason why print journalism wouldn’t benefit from a credible
regulator in the same way TV has… I’m not suggesting Ofcom should
take over. But an independent system with its own powers to
investigate wrongdoing seems an essential given what has gone wrong
in the past couple of decades. It should be at well over arm’s length from
government, exclude any serving editors from its ranks, and probably &mdash;
a very long way down the line &mdash; have recourse to the law to enforce its
will. But I would hope that the mere spectre of the law would be enough
to sort things out.</p>

<p>I repeat: If we can practise cutting-edge journalism on television
with regulation I see no reason why an Ofcom-style regulator &mdash;
although not necessarily an identical system &mdash; with full access for public
complaint, should not be perfectly applicable to the print world too. If
we have good regulation we don’t need a privacy law &mdash; it’s the
sensationalist tabloid stuff that has triggered the desire for a privacy
act. I admit I went through a phase of wanting one, but if we get
regulation right we shall get privacy right.&rdquo;</p>-->
