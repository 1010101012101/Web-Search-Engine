"The issue isn't that intellectual property laws should (or will) disappear; 
rather, they will simply become less important in the scheme of things."  
<cite>Esther Dyson, "Intellectual Property on the Net"</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>The digital age has brought with it a great deal of uncertainty 
with respect to the nature of intellectual property, indeed the idea of 
property itself.  The question of who owns and controls digital 
information cuts straight to the heart of controversial issues--from 
patents and copyrights to policing Web pages.  In order to determine 
if property should enjoy any validity at all on the net, this paper 
examines the historical development of the concept of property, 
explaining the theoretical underpinnings of property 
through the words of John Locke.  Based upon this philosophical 
treatment of property, I will show that property, specifically 
intellectual property, exhibits inconsistency vis-&agrave-vis the net, 
effectively invalidating the concept in the context of the digital medium.

<p>Property as a legal construct has existed since Roman times.  In 
fact, Roman law is the basis of modern Anglo-American property 
law, since Roman law was well-developed and recorded, delineating 
all of the "sum of rights, privileges, and powers a legal person could 
have in a thing."<a href="#eb"><sup>[1]</sup></a>  Property under the 
Roman scheme, however, was limited to what one could touch, tying 
the idea of property irrevocably to the physical realm.  Intellectual 
property was generally not recognized;  storytellers freely borrowed 
and interpreted from others with each retelling of a story.  Even 
many written works were simply one person's reinterpretation and 
re-collection of the stories of others.  As John Perry Barlow writes in 
"The Economy of Ideas":
<blockquote>
"From the Neolithic to Gutenberg (monks aside), information was 
passed on, mouth to ear, changing with every retelling (or resinging). 
The stories which once shaped our sense of the world didn't have 
authoritative versions. They adapted to each culture in which they 
found themselves being told.  Because there was never a moment 
when the story was frozen in print, the so-called "moral" right of 
storytellers to own the tale was neither protected nor recognized. 
The story simply passed through each of them on its way to the next, 
where it would assume a different form."<a 
href="#barlow"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</blockquote>
Hence, basic property law was tied intrinsically to 
<strong>tangible</strong> objects--in particular, real estate.  Barlow notes 
that the defense of this property for a great deal of history was 
based almost exclusively upon the military might of the property 
owner.

<p>At this point, we shall step back.  Tangible forms of property are 
easily defined and understood, since they are, by definition, 
contained in realspace.  However, on the net, it is the 
<strong>intangible 
</strong> forms of property that confuse everyone.  Examining 
property 
from a philosophical perspective gives us some insight into where 
the two concepts diverge--a divergence, which is critical to showing 
that property is irrelevant on the net.

<p>John Locke, a seventeenth century English philosopher, played a 
crucial role in defining Anglo-American thought with respect to 
property.  According to Locke, the most basic "property" is the most 
personal:  "every man has a 'property' in his own 'person.'"<a 
href="#locke"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  Locke binds the right of self-
preservation to this property, making it intrinsically wrong to deprive 
others of this right, as this would trespass upon the property of 
others' lives.  Locke then explains the development of tangible forms of 
property  based upon the need for survival.  The basic premise 
is that nature is owned commonly by all people.  One then acquires
property by mixing one's <strong>labor </strong> with commonly-owned 
nature, taking only so much as one needed to live; thereby, not trespassing 
on the right of others to survive, since nature contained enough 
resources for all.  Locke illustrates:
<blockquote>
"He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or 
 the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly  
appropriated them to himself. Nobody can deny but the nourishment 
is his. I ask, then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested?  
or when he ate? or when he boiled? or when he brought them home? 
or when he picked them up? And it is plain, if the first gathering 
made them not his, nothing else could. That labour put a distinction  
between them and common. That added something to them more 
than Nature, the common mother of all, had done, and so they 
became his private right."<a href="#locke"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
</blockquote>
However, Locke stresses that people were only allowed to take so 
much as they needed to survive; thereby, not trespassing on the 
right of others to survive, saying "one may engross [property] as 
much as. . . . one can make use of to any advantage of life before it 
spoils, so much he may by his labour fix a property in. Whatever is 
beyond this is more than his share, and belongs to others."<a 
href="#locke"><sup>[5]</sup></a>  Let us use the acorn example above 
to make Locke's words clearer.  If one person were to gather all of 
the acorns from the tree, you could argue that, by Locke's reasoning, 
that person should then own all of the acorns.  However, while the 
harvest of the acorns may give the person property rights, his 
inability to consume <strong>all </strong> of the acorns before they 
spoil negates 
those rights on the portion of acorns, which <strong>do </strong> 
spoil.  The 
spoiled acorns are inedible, meaning that they cannot be used by 
another to further his/her own survival, implying that the acorn-gatherer 
trespassed upon the property of others.

<p>Locke's definition of original property sounds surprisingly like 
communism.  Originally, communism was "a system of society in 
which property was owned by the community and all citizens shared 
in the enjoyment of the common wealth, more or less according to 
their need."<a href="#ebc"><sup>[6]</sup></a>  Indeed, it is important 
to note this similarity, since Locke's next discussion is the 
introduction of money, which forever altered property, and doomed 
pure communism.  

<p>As explained above, the impermanent nature of 
physical property used for survival <strong>bounded </strong> the 
amount of 
property any one person could have.  It was the universal agreement 
by society to endow certain shiny pieces of metal with value, id est, 
one could trade acorns for coins, that removed the bound on 
property:
<blockquote>
"thus came in the use of money; some lasting thing that men might 
keep without spoiling, and that, by mutual consent, men would take 
in exchange for the truly useful but perishable supports of life.  And 
as different degrees of industry were apt to give men possessions in 
different proportions, so this invention of money gave them the 
opportunity to continue and enlarge them."<a 
href="#locke"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
</blockquote>
In other words, money allowed man the capability to horde wealth, and 
thus, the enlargement of personal property also became possible.  One 
can collect all of the acorns, eat what he/she can, and then 
<strong>trade 
</strong> the rest for money--that is, "sell."  The fundamental 
question 
with respect to property changed from "How long can this keep me 
alive?" to "How many &ltinsert currency name here&gt is this 
worth?".  In other words, property became intricately intertwined 
with the concept of money, since money became the unit of measure 
of property.

<p>It is at this point that <strong>intellectual </strong> property joins 
the fray.  
Intellectual property is, after all, the most intangible form of 
property that we know of.  It cannot be touched, removing it from 
the realm of old property laws; however, it can nevertheless be 
<strong>owned, </strong> since it has monetary value.  In short, the 
introduction 
of money opened the way for intellectual property.  The late 
entrance of this form of property is reflected in what Barlow calls the 
"central economic distinction"<a href="#barlow"><sup>[8]</sup></a> 
between intellectual property and physical property, namely, the 
theft of <strong>physical </strong> property deprives the owner of 
the stolen 
good, while the "theft" of <strong>intellectual </strong> property 
merely deprives 
the creator of the <strong>pecuniary </strong> benefits of the idea.

<p>Continuing with the historical development of property 
<strong>law, </strong> 
it is easy to see the emergence of the new monetary standard.  
Copyrights and patents clearly protect not intellectual value, rather 
what Esther Dyson calls the "market value", or "what people are 
willing to <strong>pay </strong> for intellectual value."<a 
href="#dyson"><sup>[9]</sup></a>  For instance, the first copyrights 
were granted not to protect the rights of authors, but to raise 
revenue and to give the government control over publication<a 
href="#eb"><sup>[10]</sup></a>;  the Statute of Anne permanently 
made authors the (monetary) beneficiaries of their written works.  
The first patent, granted in 1421 in Florence, gave Filippo Brunelleschi a 
three year monopoly on his invention, ensuring his monetary income.  
Jumping to modern times, case after case illustrates the basic truth 
that <strong>market</strong> value is protected by intellectual 
property law:  spurious patents give companies intellectual property 
rights, which ignore the basic tendency of software programmers to 
borrow and share good ideas, e.g. Cadtrak's exclusive-or cursor 
writing, natural-order recalc in spreadsheets, backbuffering, and so 
on.<a 
href="#free"><sup>[11]</sup></a>  Copyrights have similarly led to 
long trials like the "look and feel" lawsuits of Lotus, Apple, and 
others, further illustrating the market protection copyrights afford.

<p>Having shown the monetary base of intangible property, we are 
now in a position to explore whether this definition of property can 
be upheld on the net.  Barlow notes that when he asks audiences how 
many can honestly say that they do not have unauthorized software 
on their hard disk, he never sees "more than 10 percent of the hands 
go up."<a href="#barlow"><sup>[12]</sup></a>  Indeed, software "piracy" is 
widely condemned, but also condoned, David LaMacchia notwithstanding.  
Some even say that the most financially successful software programs, also 
happen to be the programs which are pirated most often, leading to the 
hypothesis that piracy  develops popularity, which results in increased market 
share.  The electronic ether of the net, where infinite, costless, easy 
replication is possible, makes <strong>controlling</strong> replication 
unmanageable, futile, and inane.

<p>We can examine this particular issue of intellectual property law from 
two sides, both of which lead to the same conclusion:  that intellectual 
property is  irrelevant.  Let us first begin with the 
scenario of a software company tolerating the use of its pirated software; 
this is the situation that most companies find themselves in, at this time.  
That users are violating the copyright on this software is fairly well-
established.  However, inaction on the part of the property owner chips 
away at the owner's very right to this intellectual property.  We turn once 
more 
to Locke, who writes, "For I have truly no property in that which another 
can by right take from me when he pleases against my consent."<a 
href="#locke"><sup>[13]</sup></a>  Locke was arguing against the notion of 
government seizure of property, but by the same token, it implies that there 
is no notion of "property" when that property can be freely taken without 
fear of reprisal.  In fact, the nullification of ownership through inaction is 
a 
basic precept of property law, even in the physical realm:
<blockquote>
"If person A leaves the tract of land that he owns in the woods, person B 
may enter into possession of it. That second possession is wrongful as to 
person A, but person A must act to recover his possession from person B 
within the period set down in the statute of limitations. . . . One may ask 
who then owns the land. In most Anglo-American jurisdictions the
peaceable possessor of land has the right to possess that land against all 
except those who can show a better right to possession. But if person A's 
right to possession is barred by the statute of limitations, then his claim is 
not better than that of the peaceable possessor."<a 
href="#eb"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
</blockquote>
Hence, it is the <strong>responsibility</strong> of a property "owner" to 
actively pursue violations of that ownership, or ownership can be nullified.

<p>Now let us turn to the case of the software company who refuses to 
condone this behavior.  The pool of software users who have pirated 
software may be estimated at about 90% of all users, if Barlow's informal polls 
are 
any indication.  The software company may <strong>not</strong> leave 
anyone out of the dragnet, otherwise it will fall into the property 
nullification problem illustrated above.  Going after every user of 
pirated software will quickly become very expensive, in terms of legal 
costs, manpower, and time.  This will cut deeply into whatever profit 
margins the company may be making from its software.  Recalling that 
intellectual property is associated not with its intellectual value but with 
its <strong>market</strong> value, profit reductions mean, by extension, 
that the intellectual property is also falling in value.  Second, it is safe to 
assume that the software company will also decline in popularity among 
software buyers, who could feel targeted by the company--further 
reducing profits and the value of that intellectual property.

<p>Having examined a specific example, i.e., software copyright  and 
software piracy, we see that whether a company chooses to pursue 
software piracy or not, the end result is the same:  intellectual property 
becomes irrelevant--either its market value is zero, or the property right 
is nullified.  This 
is also true in the general case.  That is, generalizing to all forms of 
intellectual property on the net, including both copyrights and patents of 
all sorts, we can reach similar conclusions.  Inaction on the part of the 
owner leads to the nullification of that property right.  Meanwhile, pursuit 
of trespasses upon the property right accomplish little but further cuts in 
profits.  Imagine how much money Lotus and Borland have spent on their 
back-and-forth cases about a spreadsheet.  The resulting cuts in profits 
means that the intellectual property involved is worth less and less, not in 
terms of its intellectual value, but in monetary value--which is all that 
really matters.

<p>Many people have been working diligently on producing new ideas 
about property on the net.  For instance, Randall Davis, Pamela Samuelson, 
and others espouse a sort of copyright-patent hybrid for use on the net.  
Specifically, they propose four mechanisms:  "Traditional copyright 
protection for literal code.  Protection against behavior clones for a 
market-preserving period.  Registration of innovation to promote 
disclosure and dissemination.  A menu of off-the-shelf liability principles 
and standard licenses."<a href="#manifesto"><sup>[15]</sup></a>  However, 
developing 
new forms of intellectual property to replace or augment the old forms seems to 
lead 
to the same conclusion.  For instance, let the market-preserving 
period be six months.  As fast as technology and software change, six 
months is already fairly long.  The question arises, how many people will 
rush out to buy the new software if they <strong>know</strong> that they 
will be able to get it much cheaper within a year?  In other words, will I 
buy the $450.00 Lotus 1-2-3 now, or the $99.00 Paperback version in six 
months?  (Ignoring the possibility of free pirated copies on the net.)  If a 
majority of software buyers wait until the "generic" version 
comes out, the profit margin of the "namebrand" company will be low.  
This reduces the value of the intellectual property, as before.

<p>Meanwhile, protecting intellectual property becomes even more 
difficult.  A company will have to remain ever vigilant for abuses of copyright 
protection, behavior cloning before the end of the six months, uncompensated 
use of innovations, and the company must still learn a whole new set of rules 
about the new form of intellectual 
property, <strong>all at the same time.</strong>  In other words, this just 
leads to the same legal minefield as before, id est, endless litigation, 
endless filing of paperwork, wasted time checking the work of others for 
violations, and so forth.  In short, profit margins will continue to fall in 
relation to rising legal costs, leading to the conclusion again, that the 
intellectual property in question becomes worthless.

<p>Perhaps the most lucid writer on the subject is Esther Dyson.  Her essay 
about intellectual property on the net brings up many of the points of this 
paper without the philosophical backing.  For instance, she states "the 
price of most packaged software is <strong>tending towards</strong> 
(although not yet reaching) zero."<a href="#dyson"><sup>[16]</sup></a>  
This is a specific instance of my general claim that intellectual property is 
worthless on the net.  Dyson attributes this rightly to the easy 
reproducibility of 
intellectual property on the net, since "intellectual property that can be 
copied easily probably <strong>will</strong> be copied, destroying 
premium pricing in the middle of the curve."<a 
href="#dyson"><sup>[17]</sup></a>  Dyson suggests that companies should 
give up on the hope of profiting from intellectual property on the net, and 
instead choose alternate forms of profit like exploiting the client-support 
markets and other markets which are more personal, i.e., markets 
dependent upon the one-to-one personal interaction that the net alone 
cannot provide.  In other words, "distribute intellectual property free in 
order to sell services and relationships."<a 
href="#dyson"><sup>[18]</sup></a>  Dyson's solution is the only one which 
addresses the fundamental incongruity of intellectual property with the net 
head-on.

<p>In conclusion, information has become the most important commodity 
the world has to offer.  It is bought and sold, traded and stolen, just like 
any other commodity.  However, each of these actions is rooted in the 
implication that information can be owned, i.e., information is a form of 
property.  However, in the "meta-bottle" of "complex and highly liquid 
patterns of ones and zeroes"<a href="#barlow"><sup>[19]</sup></a> that we 
call cyberspace, intellectual property becomes irrelevant and worthless 
because of the ease of reproducibility of information on the net.  This 
paper illustrated this by drawing a distinction between physical property 
and intellectual property, noting that the latter developed as a result of 
the introduction of currency, resulting in the inseparable union of the 
value of intellectual property with its monetary value.  Observing 
that the monetary value of intellectual property on the net falls 
precipitously with every uncontrollable copy made, every lawsuit initiated, 
every man-hour spent searching for intellectual property violations, we 
see that as the monetary value of intellectual property tends towards zero, 
so does the very concept of intellectual property then tend towards 
irrelevance, at best--nullity, at worst.  Introducing new forms of 
intellectual property or even continuing the use of prior forms becomes 
entirely pointless.  The way of the future lies not in 
trying to restrict or control the propagation of information, rather in trying 
to pick through 
the sea of information to find what is truly important and necessary.  As 
John Perry Barlow writes:
<blockquote>
"Understanding is a critical element increasingly overlooked in the effort to 
turn information into a commodity. Data may be any set of facts, useful or 
not, intelligible or inscrutable, germane or irrelevant. Computers can crank 
out new data all night long without human help, and the results may
be offered for sale as information. They may or may not actually be so. 
Only a human being can recognize the meaning that separates information 
from data.  
In fact, information, in the economic sense of the word, consists of data 
which have been passed through a particular human mind and found 
meaningful within that mental context. One fella's information is all just 
data to someone else."<a href="#barlow"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
